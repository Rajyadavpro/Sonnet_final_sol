  "sop_steps_modification": "Here are the steps from the SOP with the required modifications to create a tailored solution for the ticket.\n\n*   **STEP 1- Go to sonnet and select the company.**\n    *   **Modification:** This step needs to be tailored. Instead of a generic company, you must select the company mentioned in the ticket, which is **Regional Management**.\n\n*   **STEP 2- Open pg-admin and paste the below query**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed for this step's instruction. However, the query itself needs significant changes.\n\n*   **Query - `update dispute set sonnet_status = 'Worked' where company_id = 24400 and response_due_date < '2025-03-22' and sonnet_status = 'Active'`**\n    *   **Modification:** This query needs to be modified to match the ticket's specific request. Additionally, a second query must be created to handle the WIP queue, which is not covered in the original SOP.\n        1.  **Modify the existing query for the 'Active' queue:**\n            *   The `company_id` must be changed from `24400` to the ID for **Regional Management**.\n            *   The date condition `response_due_date < '2025-03-22'` must be changed to `response_due_date <= '2025-08-21'` to match the request for disputes with a due date of \"8/21 and sooner\".\n            *   The modified query will be:\n                `update dispute set sonnet_status = 'Worked' where company_id = [ID for Regional Management] and response_due_date <= '2025-08-21' and sonnet_status = 'Active'`\n        2.  **Add a new query for the 'WIP' queue:**\n            *   A new query must be created to handle the request to also remove disputes from the WIP queue.\n            *   The new query will be:\n                `update dispute set sonnet_status = 'Worked' where company_id = [ID for Regional Management] and response_due_date <= '2025-08-21' and sonnet_status = 'WIP'`\n\n*   **STEP 3- Check the disputes whether it has deleted or not in the dispute page.**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed for this step. It is a standard verification step to confirm the queries ran successfully.\n\n*   **Step 4 – Give a response to the ticket and mark it as solved.**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed for this step. It is the standard final action."
