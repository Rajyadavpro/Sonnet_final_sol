  "issue": "The issue is that the client, Jovia, is receiving a very low number of disputes. Their Sonnet dashboard indicates that 105 disputes are stuck in a \"waiting for DNA data\" status. This means the disputes have been downloaded from e-OSCAR but are not moving into the active queue to be worked on because they are awaiting data from the client's system of record (DNA).\n\n###",
  "sop_title": "The title of the SOP that best solves this ticket is **Sym-exchange.txt**. The use case described in the SOP, \"Disputes are in new state want to pushed over to active,\" directly matches the problem of disputes being stuck in the \"waiting for DNA data\" (New) status.\n\n###",
  "sop_content": "```\nUSE CASE 9 - Disputes are in new state want to pushed over to active (Sym-exchange) or Load the dispute.\n\nStep 1 – Go to the sonnet and select the company.\n                                                                      \nStep 2 – Go to Pg-admin and type query as    à select id from dispute where company_id = ____ and sonnet_status = 'New'\nStep 3 – Once u execute the step 2 you will get the id below..\n\nStep 4 – Go to sonnet admin and select the rules engine queue from the dispute section and paste the id one by one and click submit.\n                                               \nStep 6 – Run the Rules engine command in the command prompt till u find the company id.\n\nStep 7 – Once you run the rules engine queue in the command prompt data waiting in the Sym-exchange should be changed to 0.\n                             \nStep 8 – Give a response and mark the ticket as solved.\n```\n\n###",
  "sop_steps_modification": "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the SOP with the necessary modifications for the Jovia ticket.\n\n*   **Step 1 – Go to the sonnet and select the company.**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed. The specific company to select is **Jovia**.\n\n*   **Step 2 – Go to Pg-admin and type query as à select id from dispute where company_id = ____ and sonnet_status = 'New'**\n    *   **Modification:** The blank for `company_id` needs to be filled with Jovia's specific company ID. The query should be: `select id from dispute where company_id = [Jovia's Company ID] and sonnet_status = 'New'`.\n\n*   **Step 3 – Once u execute the step 2 you will get the id below..**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed. This step is an instruction.\n\n*   **Step 4 – Go to sonnet admin and select the rules engine queue from the dispute section and paste the id one by one and click submit.**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed. This step is a clear instruction.\n\n*   **Step 5 (Missing in original SOP)**\n    *   **Modification:** The original SOP jumps from Step 4 to Step 6. This step is assumed to be the execution of the rules engine.\n\n*   **Step 6 – Run the Rules engine command in the command prompt till u find the company id.**\n    *   **Modification:** This step is vague. To make it actionable, the specific commands from the SOP **\"Steps to run the rules engine.txt\"** should be used.\n        1.  Connect to the rules engine server: `az ssh vm --vm-name prdre01 --resource-group rg-PaliPRD-LAN --prefer-private-ip --subscription Sonnet_Production_Environment`\n        2.  Switch to the sonnet user: `$sudo su sonnet`\n        3.  Change to the correct directory: `$cd /sonnet/rules-engine/rules-engine-python/`\n        4.  Run the rules engine command: `$python rules_engines_mod.py`\n        5.  Monitor the output until Jovia's company ID appears to confirm the disputes are being processed.\n\n*   **Step 7 – Once you run the rules engine queue in the command prompt data waiting in the Sym-exchange should be changed to 0.**\n    *   **Modification:** The term \"Sym-exchange\" should be replaced with the client's terminology. The instruction should be: \"Once the rules engine has run, the 'waiting for DNA data' count on the Jovia dashboard should change from 105 to 0.\"\n\n*   **Step 8 – Give a response and mark the ticket as solved.**\n    *   **Modification:** No modification is needed. A suitable response to the client would be: \"We have identified and resolved the issue causing disputes to be stuck. The 105 disputes are now processed and available in your active queue. Please let us know if you encounter any further problems.\""
