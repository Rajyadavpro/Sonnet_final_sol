Sonnet Services and Communications

What Sonnet services are involved in ACDV downloads

What Sonnet services are involved in ACDV responses to eOSCAR

What Sonnet services are involved in the creation of ACDV receipts

Some companies are reporting they don’t have any disputes to work in today. Order the checklist to research the possible issue:
Review Sonnet web app logs				- 4
Review Rules engine logs				- 3
Review eOSCAR Connector logs			- 2
Check on Admin dashboard				- 1
Ask customers about further evidence		- 5

Some companies are reporting they are recently missing ACDV receipts. Order the checklist to research the issue:
Ask customers about further evidence
Review Sonnet web app logs
Review eOSCAR Connector logs
Review Notary Logs					- 1 (and only 1)
Review Sonnet Probe logs				- 
Check on Admin dashboard

Given a company alias (company_abbreviation) and a date, what’s the expected log path to trace associated events to a control number or action?
/sonnet/scrape/logs/2025/Feb/alias/xxxx13.log

Many log entries use what internally is called “fingerprint”. What is that being used for?
CompanyAlias: Type(ACDV/AUD..):Action/Buerue:ControllerNumber
credencerm:ACDV:Download:384878
credencerm:ACDV:EFX:99995030531194023
To locate the records during troubleshooting


A company is reporting issues with some responded ACDVs. In their side, they find no actual responses, but Sonnet does show the specific Control Numbers as responded on 2025-02-10. What are the services and log path you must verify to further analyze the response events
Sonnet Admin 
DB
eOscar Connector
/sonnet/scrape/logs/2025/Feb/alias/acdv-response.20250210.log


A client is requesting a new strategy to split download batches into their three companies. Which Services can potentially require new features?

What’s the attachment(images) recovery process in Sonnet?
Create a new download recovery job in the affected environment
Query e-OSCAR manually to get the data for the specific artifacts
Replicate the environment locally and provide the attachments to Support. (On-Demand special cases)

A couple of company responses have been stuck for a while. There seem to be no progress in the responses list despite the API user is being marked intermittently as “in-use”. What’s the recommended sequence of actions in that scenario?
Report the issue to the support team					- 1
Verify there is data to submit						- 2
Toggle the “in-use” switch							- 4
Create a bug task in your Sprint placeholder				- 5
Dig into the company response logs to find out any abnormal situation	- 3

A client has reported issues with the data in their AUD receipts. A field value in the PDF is not matching with was reported. You have been assigned the corresponding User story. Describe your process to task out the story and explain your reasoning for each one.

There has been an alarming number of companies without downloads today. Describe your process to research/fix the situation and explain your reasoning on each step.

FILE 2: AAD PostgreSQL Setup.txt
================================================================================

AAD PostgreSQL Setup

To register and login Azure PostgreSQL servers, the following procedure, step by step, must be performed.  Also, each login will require repeating certain steps as noted.

Open a terminal or command line application and type in the following command as shown below: (az login)



Select the appropriate account as shown below:




Once the account is selected, the following page will be displayed after a successful login:



The terminal will show the following output:




Next, type in the following command as show below: (az account get-access-token --resource https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net)



The following output from the command in Step 5 will be display as follows:



NOTE!  The accessToken value between the double quotes will need to be used as the password for logging into PostgreSQL servers the account is authorized for during the current session.  Do not close the terminal window or the process will need to be repeated from Step 1.


Open and login to the Azure Portal and the AADPIM (Azure AD Privileged Identity Management) area as shown below: (Entering Azure AD Privileged Identity Management in the search bar within the Azure Portal will also navigate to the appropriate landing page)



Select on the “Groups” item in the list at the left side of the page as shown below:



After the redirect occurs and the new page loads, select the appropriate group shown below:



After the page redirects from Step 9, click on the “Activate” link on the page that loads as shown below:




After clicking “Activate”, the following tab will be displayed and must be completed, see example below: (Make sure to put in the necessary information under the “Reason” for accessing an upper environment, such as a CR number or other appropriate reason, then click on “Activate” to complete the process.)




Once the “Activate” button is clicked, a series of operations will take place as shown in the following screenshots shown:









The image above represents the landing page that will be displayed after the two preceding images processes are completed.  The AADPIM process is now completed, and no further action currently is necessary within the portal.

Open pgAdmin, enter the master password for the installation locally.  Once loaded, right click on the “Servers” item in the list, then “Register”, then “Server” as shown below:




The following screenshots show the registration details, but those will vary according to the server being register and are only provided as an example with one exception.  The username for ALL registrations MUST be the AAD Group shown, which is the same group which was used in Steps 7-11.  Also note that during the setup, make sure to deselect the “Connect now?” option before clicking the “Save” button.  Images on the left show the state before clicking “Save”.  Images on the right show a successfully registered server as well as the required entries for the given fields.

 

 
Double click on the newly registered server as shown below:




The following password entry dialog will be displayed.  Copy the accessToken that was created from Step 5 and displayed in Step 6.  Take care to copy only the value between the double quotes and do not include the double quotes.  This value will be the password that is required to be entered into the dialog box as shown below: (Note!  Do not click “Save Password” as a new accessToken will likely be required upon next login.  Tokens expire regularly and will not last longer than 4-8 hours.  These tokens are randomly assigned expiry dates and times.  Once done pasting the accessToken, click on the “OK” button to complete the login process.



After clicking “OK”, and provided the correct accessToken has been entered, the following screenshot shows a successful login:



The process is now complete, no further actions are required unless the token expires.  If the token expires, all steps must be repeated, omitting Step 12 and Step 13 if the AADPIM has expired.  If AADPIM has not expired, Step 7 through Step 13 will be omitted.

FILE 8: Azure_New_Client_Implementation-Backend.txt
================================================================================

Azure Client Implementation Back End 
Objective:  Set up the automation for new clients; setup may include creating the applicable server directories and FTP Users, updating automation scripts, and allowing access to Palinode production servers.     


Create Directory on prdrpa01 and prdrpa02 Servers 
All Clients will need a directory on prdrpa01, prdrpa02.  Without these directories or an incorrect setup of a directory, downloading from e-Oscar will cause degraded server performance. 
Log into the prdrpa01 and prdrapa02 Servers (sudo su – sonnet)
Go to the directory /sonnet/images:   $ cd /sonnet/images.  All companies have a directory where images are placed. 
Run the script to make the company directories.  This script uses sudo command to change permissions.   
$ ./make_dirs.sh companyabbreviation 
Enter server password if prompted
Verify the directory was created correctly and the permissions and owner match other company folders.  ($ ll) 
Also verify the directory in cd /sonnet_attachments/www has the correct permissions and owner. 
To change owner run $ sudo chown sonnet:sonnet companyabbreviation 
Enter server password 
To change folder permissions run $ sudo chmod 775 companyabbreviation 
Enter server password 
If company using API proceed to API Data Exchange 
If company using Batch files proceed to FTP Data Exchange 

API Data Exchange 
Create the company's directory in prdapi01  if the client is using the API.    
Create Directory on prdapi01 Server 
Log into prdapi01 
Go to the directory /sonnet/images:   $ cd /sonnet/images 
Make a directory with the company abbreviation as the name:  $ mkdir companyabbreviation) 
Check the owner and permissions by listing the contents of the /sonnet/images/ directory.  Should be sonnet and drwxrwxr-x 
If owner is not sonnet for the directory created change the owner ($ sudo chown -R sonnet:sonnet companyabbreviation/ ) 
If permissions are incomplete change the permissions ($ sudo chmod -R 775 companyabbrevition/) 
Repeat step 4 


Update Move API Images Script 
This script moves images from the company's prdrpa01 and prdrap02  server directory to the company's prdapi01 server directory for companies using the API Data Exchange method. *CollectOne platform clients use FTP for image transfers and will need to be added to the Move Images script instead of Move API Images. 
Update local repository.  If using Visual Studio Code (VS) open the folder with move images repository.   
Make sure you're on the master branch by using the git command "git status" in the Terminal.  If not on branch master use git command "git checkout master" which will update the branch to master. 
The command "git pull" will refresh your local repository.  
Create a branch named with the following naming convention:  companyIDzdtID 1000zdt1958  
Open the move_api_images.php and add the Company ID to api_company_ids list starting on line 13.  Save changes. 
Open the. gitignore and add the company abbreviation to the end of the list /companyabbreviation.  Save changes 
Stage changes for commit then commit the saved changes.  The commit comments should provide a summary of the change.  Example:  Added companyabbreviation to API move images and gitignore. 
Git push or Push to push branch to bitbucket 
Go to the Move Images branches in move-images - Repos (azure.com), locate your branch and create a pull request.  The reviewer should be Lidiexy.   
After the branch is approved, Lidiexy will merge the branch into master and pull the changes on the noon server. 
NOTE:  This is not complete until the branch is merged by approver. 
 
Whitelist Company's IP for prdapi01 Server 
ZenDesk Ticket should include the public IP address that should be whitelisted for the company.  The public IP address may be different that the Sonnet user's public IP address. 
Open up Cato https://palinode.auth.catonetworks.com ->Network -> IP Allocation -> Remote Port Forwarding
Add the companies IP address to sonnetapi.palinode.io port 443
 
Note the ZenDesk ticket with the CATO whitelisting when complete. 

Test Connection 
Provide company API Token and API URL via ShareFile link on the ZenDesk ticket. 
Create a text document with the format below, update the <API Token> with the company's API Token and save in the Company's folder: 
 
  
To create and share a ShareFile link, go to https://palinode.sharefile.com/dashboard and select Share Files.  Attach the text document then Get Link.  Share the link with the company contact on the ticket. 
The client should see the response   
 
Setup for API company is complete.  Update ZenDesk ticket. 
Troubleshooting 
Client using URL, but the request is timing out. 
Public IP address used does not match whitelisted IP.  Check the api_log in the database 
Select * from api_log where company_id=companyid order by created_on desc 
Check the IP Address of the request and verify matches whitelisted IP.   
 

FTP Data Exchange 
Create the company's directory in Prdweb01 if the client is using Batch files. *CollectOne platform clients are API but will use this for image transfers. 
Create Directory on Prdweb01 Server 
Log into Prdweb01 
Go to the directory /sonnet/ftpdir:  $ cd /sonnet/ftpdir 
Run the script to make the company directories.  This script uses sudo command to change permissions.   
$ ./make_dirs.sh companyabbreviation 
Enter your server password 
Verify the directory was created correctly and the permissions and owner match other company folders. 


Update Move Images Azure Script 


This script is run every hour to transfer files from prdrpa01, prdrap02 to prdweb01 with logging. 
Update local repository.  If using Visual Studio Code (VS) open the folder with move images repository.   
Make sure you're on the master branch by using the git command "git status" in the Terminal.  If not on branch master use git command "git checkout master" which will update the branch to master. 
The command "git pull" will refresh your local repository.  
Create a branch named with the following naming convention:  companyIDzdtID 1000zdt1958  
Open the move_images.sh and add the following to the last line of the file with the company's abbreviation companyabbreviation is listed. 

/usr/bin/rsync -avz --remove-source-files --log-file=/sonnet/images/logs/companyabbreviation.`date +"%Y%m%d"`.log /sonnet/images/ companyabbreviation /* /sonnet/ftpdir/companyabbreviation/images
 
Save changes. 
Open the. gitignore and add the company abbreviation to the end of the list /companyabbreviation.   
Save changes 
Stage changes for commit then commit the saved changes.  The commit comments should provide a summary of the change.  Example:  Added companyabbreviation to API move images and gitignore. 
Git push or Push to push branch to Azure 
Go to the Move Images branches in Azure, locate your branch and create a pull request.  The reviewer should be Lidiexy.   
After the branch is approved, Lidiexy will merge the branch into master and pull the changes on the noon server. 
NOTE:  This is not complete until the branch is merged by approver. 
 


FTP 
If Sonnet is hosting the FTP (Client Gets and Puts files on Sonnet's FTP) proceed to Sonnet Hosted FTP 
If Company is hosting the FTP (Sonnet Puts and Gets files on Company's FTP) proceed to External FTP 




Sonnet Hosted FTP 
     Whitelist Company's IP for Incoming Access via CATO to remote port forwarding
ZenDesk Ticket should include the public IP address that should be whitelisted for the company.  The public IP address may be different that the Sonnet user's public IP address 
Add to the SFTP Gateway groups (22, 38122, 30000-31000) in Cato 
 
 
 
 
 
     Create FTP User for Company

FILE 28: MultiEndpointSupport.txt
================================================================================

Overview

As JHA’s integrated services platform has grown over recent years, coupled with the tendency to move services to the Cloud, the number of supporting environments for a given institution may utilize more than a single server farm.  These environments, or farms, are established to meet needs concerning capacity, provider services and location of data.  
To support this, consumers are required to support multiple endpoints for an institution. As a consumer, you must prepare for the possibility that not all operations will utilize the same endpoint.  With those endpoints, the message credentials and the jXchangeHdr values must also be configurable to correlate to multiple environments.
Normally, the boundary separating environments are the providers themselves.  Core based services, 4Sight and Synergy are just a few of the providers and may have separate endpoints for an institution.   Multiple endpoints/environments are not present for every situation but are increasing in frequency.   At a high level, the link to group multiple endpoints is the Institution itself, then the provider.  At the bottom level, each operation is associated with a given endpoint.
During a production environment implementation, the IDG Operations team will provide access information for each configured provider.  This information may contain a single or multiple endpoints.  
This document is provided to help you understand these requirements.   Below are diagrams to help visualize this concept.  



Single tenant applications supporting multiple endpoints

The following diagrams are provided merely as examples of how an application might be required to access multiple endpoints for a particular institution.  This does not imply that certain providers are grouped within an environment.

FILE 30: Palinode - SSO Setup 2.txt
================================================================================

Table of Content


Introduction

This document will guide you through the steps on how to create a custom Single Sign On (SSO) application in Azure Portal using Entra ID and SAML configuration. This will make it possible for Sonnet to provide SSO authentication for your users in your organization.
The SSO ID is needed to begin the setup and is provided by Sonnet. The SSO ID is the string used to customize specific authentication URLs, only allowed to your organization. The sso_id placeholder will appear many times in this guide, make sure to replace it with your real SSO ID in your setup.
After the SSO Application is created and configured in your organization environment, provide the following parameters to Sonnet:
SSO application Login URL
SSO application Logout URL
Microsoft Entra Identifier
Base64 encoded certificate (the .cer file provided by Entra ID)
Depending on your organization policies, you can instead provide the Federation Metadata XML. file. That file can be downloaded at the end of the setup and contains all the information required by Sonnet.

Creating a Custom Azure Application for Sonnet

You will first create a custom Azure application. Sonnet will use this application within your organization to request login and logout actions through SAML. Ensure this Azure application is created in the same context your organization’s user accounts reside, since this application is the only way Sonnet will be able to consume the correct user sessions.

Navigate to Azure Portal(https://portal.azure.com) and access Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD)

If quick access is not available on the landing page of your Azure portal, you can use the search bar to search for “Entra ID” at the top of your portal.

Once inside Entra ID, select “Enterprise Applications”.


Use the New Application link in the top menu section. 
 
Select “Create your own application” from the top menu section. It will open a right-side drawer with a small form.

Enter some name for the custom application so you can easily identify it among others (we recommend Sonnet-SSO) and make sure to select the bottom option Non-gallery. Click on the Create button at the bottom of the form.  It will take a few seconds and then open the new application overview page.


Configure SAML SSO in the new application.

For the SAML configuration, use the SSO ID for your organization provided by Sonnet. Use the SSO ID in the setup to replace the sso_id placeholder. This placeholder will appear a couple of times in the following steps, so do not forget to use the provided SSO ID instead.

In the Sonnet Application page, select the option 2. Set up single sign on. 

If option 2. Set up single sign on is not available, you can use the option Single sign-on in the left-side menu bar.

Tip: After creation, the new application will also be searchable. Type in the name used in Step 5 and select the link.

Select the box SAML from the options available for single sign-on. It will open a new page with many options to configure SAML. 


The many options available are grouped into 4 categories. You only need to set values for the first two.
You should be able to edit each group using the pen icon at the top-right corner of each box. Every edition will open a right-side menu form, like the one used while creating the custom app.

Basic SAML Configuration. The SSO ID will be used here. Sonnet does not support SAML sign-on and that is why the Sign on URL is not required.




Attributes & Claims. Because Sonnet maintains the ownership of user roles and details, the email address is the only claim currently required. It is used to link the SAML authentication with a valid Sonnet session.
The main goal is to assign e-mail address as required.

Click on the required claim row. In the new form, select user.mail as the Source Attribute.

Use the link Save in the top menu options. You can add or remove any number of attributes. Sonnet only needs to get emailaddress. The bare minimum required by Sonnet is:




Configuration parameters required by Sonnet.

After completing the SAML setup for the custom Azure application, your environment is ready to accept SAML2 authentication requests. Now we will need to know the resulting details of your setup to make it possible to provide the SSO service on Sonnet.

To provide configuration details for Sonnet, we will need the information available in the third and fourth categories in the very same SAML Single sign-on setup page.

Download the Base64 certificate. This can be found in the first Download link at the third box.

Copy all three URLs available in the fourth category box

Create a zip file with all this info and send an encrypted email to support@palinode.io  containing the following:
Certificate (Base64)
URLs – Login URL, Microsoft Entra Identifier and Logout URL
Alternatively, you can get all that information by downloading the Federation Metadata XML. That’s the third link in the SAML Certificates box. You can zip it and send it to Sonnet.

OK.
All right, so SSO is single sign on. So that's like what we use whenever you're logging into Sonnet. It gives you just the just a Click to sign in.
So that's something that we offer for for our clients as well. So on the company screens there is a single sign on section is where you're going to look for these kind of setups and it's it's pretty straightforward. So there's a few.
URLs that we need from their setup and then there's a certificate that they send us that we need. This is the most important, the SSO ID, which we always just use the company abbreviation or the alias.
We use that same thing for this for the for the ID. Whenever this is what turns SSO on is whenever the SSO ID is entered. That is what activates SSO for the client so.
If someone is like if there's an active client that's like testing and like wants to start using SSO and you're and they're trying to go live, this is how you would control turning it on and off is just by putting the SSOID in OK.
So as far as getting these URLs and the certificate, this is all provided by the client and we do have set up information for them. So our setup document is already here in our shared documents folder. I put it with the new client setup information since that's.
Typically, who's going to be using this? But so. So whenever a client is wanting to start using SSO, this is the document that you're going to send them.
And it has. It's pretty straightforward as far as like what they need to do to get it set up. Usually this goes very smoothly and they provide the URLs and the certificate. You just copy and paste it all into the setup and usually it just works.
So there is. We've had one client so far that's been having a lot of trouble with it. I've had a couple calls with them trying to troubleshoot along with their vendor. So whenever someone has trouble, you guys just need to escalate. You guys just need to get someone on the dev team involved.
I don't know if Natish or Vinay is is taking over that part, but yeah, but so if a client's trying to set this up, you've sent them the information, they've sent you the URLs, you've plugged everything in.
And something's not working. Go to the dev team, get help to figure it out, like escalate however you need to. OK, so don't be don't be afraid to do that and engage the dev team for help, but it should be pretty straightforward.
And so as far as what all that looks like, let me see, do I still have?
I wonder if I still have a.
Copy of someone.
So this one.
Yeah.
All right, here's a good one.
Alright, so this is usually a usually whenever they're sending it to you, like sending you the SSO information.
Uh.
This is what it looks like. OK, I already have it.
Oh.
This is a JPAG. What's this?
OK, yeah. Oh yeah. So this is the one that was having trouble.
Uh, yes. So that's just a screenshot. OK, alright, so that's not a good one.
I want like a complete one.
That doesn't look like OK.
Right. Uh, anyway. Uh, yeah.
But that's it. So it's all just copy and paste is is really all you guys need to should have to do.
Oh.
I really would like to find.
The completed one.
It's the folder.
Let's just do this.
There we go. Alright, yeah, so this is generally what you're gonna get from the clients. It's just gonna be.
Text file, Word document, whatever it is with the URLs. So you just copy and paste from there and then the cert.
Start I believe you want to open up with either notepad plus plus or or notepad so you can get to the certificate and then yeah, so you just copy like the entire middle part would be all of that.
Is what you would copy.
And that's what you would face here.
And that's it for SSO. That's that's really all you have to do to turn it on.
So like I said, so you'll just send a if anyone ever asks for it.
This is the setup instructions that you're gonna send them.
And they should be able to just follow it.
I guess we should take a look or a closer look here. So the these instructions are designed only for Azure since that's what we use for RSSO. So this is the only real documentation that we have on it. So if someone is.
Same like they use like a different software. The instructions are basically the same, so they'll still use the same document. But yeah, but we don't have anything specific for any other type of software.
Um, so this this is all we got.
All right. And that's it for SSO. All right. So GPG is a little bit more complicated. Well, I mean, not really. So the setup, whenever you're setting up GPG, same thing with SSO, you're going to work with the dev team to kind of get it done.
Uh, 'cause it is a little.
Is a little tricky and just involves just some high-level knowledge. So if anyone is requesting to set up encryption, you're still going to you will. You'll probably want to create a dev task and work with whoever.
Peter Vinay, Natish.
Whoever does to get it, uh, get up and running, we do have.
Instructions here inside of the knowledge base in Zendesk as far as generating a file.
Or actually not even generate a file. This is for decrypting the file. So let's say let's say we need to look at.
Say like we're onboarding like a new client and we're going through like the normal data validation process, like looking at their step files, making sure they're sending everything in the correct fields. These are the commands that this is how you're going to decrypt a file.
Um, so uh, like a good.
Let's use golden one here.
Oh, we don't have a Step 2. Darn it.
Who else uses encryption? Redcock does.
Uh, OK, this should work.
Alright.
So we used GPG encryption by default. It's very similar to PGP, just a different format. Yeah, so not really any difference there, but yeah.
So.
Uh, this is the command that we use to decrypt a file.
And then I have an example right below it of like one that's actually plugged in. Oh, snap on this one. OK.
I'm gonna go over there.
Let's do that, actually.
OK, sweet.
Yeah, alright, so this is the command that we're gonna use. So I'm gonna copy all of this.
I'm gonna leave that last part out because I'm just gonna type that myself.
So.
Here is our command.
All right, so the first thing that we need to change here is what I have in Alex is stuff that needs to be plugged in. So the first thing it's asking for is the output file name.
File name.
So we want to remove that variable from the command, and we're just going to use the same name.
Of the file that we're trying to decrypt, so I'm gonna copy that.
So right there. And so that's what our output file's gonna look like is it's just gonna be a regular CSV.
Alright, and we are running this from ftpdir snap on credit slash processed.
Alright, and then we need the original file name.
Choose this.
All right.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I need to Sudosu Sonic first.
And then I can run the command. Alright, so this should decrypt the file for us and boom.
All right, so this is what it looks like whenever it successfully decrypts.
The self contents and there is our file.
So if you're ever trying to troubleshoot an issue with a file, if you like, if you're looking for just like we do with our regular step 2 files, like if we need to go in and look for something, trying to find an account like whatever it is, this is our command to decrypt the files.
And you really just gotta make sure that you put in the new file name that you're gonna use.
And the original file is at the end, so it's pretty straightforward. It's not a lot. And then.
If you ever need to send our secret key to anyone, so this is like so they can add it to their key ring so they can decrypt the files on their end. This is the location.
That the key is in, so if we.
Go over there.
Home.
Select.
It lists U to contents.
All right.
And it is pass one is our is the actual key file.
And that is listed right here in the command. That's how you can tell that that's what it's calling.

Manjunath S   13:05
And James, this is related to somewhat like the files or the images.

James Maki   13:10
This is mainly going to be for STEP files. There are a couple clients that also use it for images, but that's that's more of a custom kind of a thing and that's something that you would escalate to the dev team and work with them on.
So like that's like Barclays is doing that and Liddy has been helping me with that one to try and get to try and get them live. So yeah, so there are you you may have clients ask for it on their images and if they do.
Oh, you'll just work with the dev team.
Which, and honestly, honestly, you're probably gonna be working with the dev team anyway to to get this set up. I I always do.

Manjunath S   13:49
OK.

James Maki   14:00
It it's just a better way to go about it, like to make sure it's handled correctly because I'm not. I'm definitely not an expert at this either. So yeah, like as far as like setting up a new key and like adding a a new client, I'm not familiar with that myself.
Uh.
So yeah, again, just uh, engage the dev team whenever you're not sure how to do something.
And that's gonna be our.
It's gonna be one of our new mottos.
But yeah, right. And then as far as setting up, is there, do I have anything else? I don't think I do.
Do I have anything else on GPG?
Doesn't look like it.
Yeah.
Yeah, so so if you ever get a ticket from the implementation team like saying like a like a client wants to set up SSO, our our our process is gonna be to create a dev task and work with them to get it set up.
Make sure that the keys get exchanged properly and are added in the correct location, so I believe.
Uh.
I believe whenever we receive a key.
Just go into that private folder.
Sure.
I think they just go in here. I think if someone ever sends us like a new key, I think it just goes in this folder. But again, engage the dev team whenever you aren't sure to to make sure it's done correctly.
Don't. Don't be. Don't be afraid to escalate.
And that's really all I have.
To show you guys on this like there is. There isn't much to it.
Yeah, it.
It can feel a little complicated, but it's it's actually not. This is the biggest thing. Yeah, like if you ever need to decrypt files.
Uh.
And uh, just for the sake of.
Uh, I'm gonna say this into our documents folder also. Uh, just to try to keep everything together so you guys aren't having to.
Go searching all around.
Um.
There.
All right.
Added that to the documents as well, so you guys can easily find that right on that. And that's really all I have on the subject. Do you guys have any questions?

Manjunath S   17:59
No, James.

James Maki   18:00
Yeah, like it is pretty straightforward. Um, yeah. So hopefully you guys, I don't think you guys will have any trouble with this. It's.

Manjunath S   18:09
I think we recorded this session.

James Maki   18:11
Uh, yes, I did record it, yes.

Manjunath S   18:13
That's a time of thank you.

James Maki   18:15
Absolutely.
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, that's all I got for you right now. If if you guys don't have any questions on this stuff, I'll go ahead and.
In the recording to get this out there for you guys.

Manjunath S   18:34
Yeah, right now, no jumps.

James Maki   18:38
OK.
Right, good stuff.

They highlighted the different tiles on the dashboard, such as the E Oscar response queue, disputes waiting for system of record data, and disputes received and completed today.
Dashboard Purpose: Andrea explained that the Sonnet dashboard provides at-a-glance information about disputes and behind-the-scenes processes involving data exchanges with clients. The dashboard is the landing page when users log into Sonnet.
Data Exchange Process: Andrea described the data exchange process, where Sonnet reaches out to E Oscar to download disputes and exchanges data with clients. Clients provide consumer and account information, which Sonnet displays side by side for users to work on disputes. Completed dispute information is sent back to both E Oscar and the client.
Dashboard Tiles: Andrea highlighted various tiles on the dashboard, including the E Oscar response queue (disputes waiting to be sent back to E Oscar), disputes waiting for system of record data (disputes downloaded from E Oscar but awaiting client data), disputes received today, disputes completed today, and disputes within 5 days of the due date.
Dispute Backlog: Andrea mentioned the dispute backlog graphic, which shows the total number of disputes in Sonnet, the number of days until disputes are due, and the queues where disputes are located (active queue, QA queue, work in progress queue).
Data Exchange Frequency: Khushboo inquired about the frequency of data updates from the system of records. Andrea explained that for most clients, the data exchange happens once per day, with some high-volume clients exchanging data a few times a day.
Frequency of Updates: Andrea explained that the data exchange with clients typically happens once per day because E Oscar pushes out new disputes at one time during the day. This frequency is sufficient for most clients as there are not many new disputes throughout the day.
High-Volume Clients: For very high-volume clients, data exchanges may occur a few times a day to handle the larger volume of disputes. This ensures timely updates and processing of disputes.
Periodic Data Pulls: Andrea mentioned that clients might want to pull data more frequently to get responses back after users have worked on disputes throughout the day. This allows clients to periodically update their records with completed dispute information.
Dashboard Customization: Khushboo asked if the dashboard is customizable by clients. Andrea confirmed that the dashboard is static and not customizable by clients.
Dashboard Interactivity: L Shashank asked if the dashboard tiles are interactive and if data can be exported to Excel for deeper analysis. Andrea explained that the dashboard is not interactive, but there is a reporting section that supports some of the information displayed on the dashboard.
Custom Reporting: L Shashank inquired about custom reports requested by clients. Andrea explained that custom reports are added to the reporting section, and if a report is applicable globally, it is added as a global report.
Dispute Queues Overview: Andrea provided an overview of the different dispute queues, including the active queue, work in progress queue, QA queue, completed today queue, and error queue. They explained the purpose and functionality of each queue.
Active Queue: Andrea explained that the active queue contains disputes for which data has been received from the client and are ready for users to work on. It also includes disputes at risk of expiring or those repeatedly presented to the client without data.
Work in Progress Queue: The work in progress queue is a global queue visible to all users. It allows users to save their progress on a dispute and return to it later. Disputes in this queue are associated with the user's name who moved them there.
QA Queue: The QA queue is a permissions-based queue typically accessed by supervisors. Users can send disputes to the QA queue for additional review, especially for complex disputes or when a new employee is being trained. The supervisor is responsible for completing and submitting the disputes from this queue.
Completed Today Queue: The completed today queue contains disputes that have been completed and submitted back to E Oscar on the same day. This queue helps track the daily progress of dispute resolutions.
Error Queue: The error queue contains disputes that were rejected by E Oscar due to errors. Users can correct the errors and resubmit the disputes. The error messages from E Oscar are specific, helping users identify and fix the issues quickly.
Work in Progress Queue: Khushboo asked if a dispute saved in the work in progress queue can be picked up by someone else. Andrea confirmed that it can be picked up by another user, and all changes made by different users are logged.
QA Queue: Andrea explained the QA queue, which is a permissions-based queue typically accessed by supervisors. Users can send disputes to the QA queue for additional review, especially for complex disputes or when a new employee is being trained.
Error Queue: Andrea described the error queue, which contains disputes that were rejected by E Oscar due to errors. Users can correct the errors and resubmit the disputes.
Error Identification: Andrea explained that the error queue contains disputes rejected by E Oscar due to errors. The error messages from E Oscar are specific, indicating the exact issue that needs to be corrected, such as an incorrect response code or a bad value in the payment history.
Error Correction: Users can open disputes from the error queue, correct the identified errors, and resubmit the disputes to E Oscar. This process ensures that disputes are accurately resolved and accepted by E Oscar.
Timing of Errors: Andrea mentioned that errors are communicated with E Oscar via an API, and responses are sent back throughout the day. Disputes can be returned in error status within approximately 5 minutes, allowing for quick correction and resubmission.
Monitoring Error Queue: All users have visibility of the error queue, and they typically monitor and correct errors throughout the day. This ensures that errors are addressed promptly and disputes are resolved efficiently.
Custom Work Queues: Andrea explained that clients can configure custom work queues based on certain fields. These queues are commonly used to separate disputes with higher complexity or specific types, such as fraud or bankruptcy-related disputes.
Dispute Assignment: L Shashank asked if custom work queues can be assigned to specific users. Andrea explained that custom work queues are visible to all users, and the management of queues is handled by clients through their policies and procedures.
Dispute Locking: Vinay asked about locking disputes when multiple people are assigned to the same queue. Andrea explained that disputes are locked when a user is actively working on them, and other users cannot access the locked dispute.
Dispute Unlocking: L Shashank asked about unlocking disputes if a user pauses work and does not return. Amanda explained that disputes are automatically unlocked after 15 minutes of inactivity, and users can send disputes to the work in progress queue with notes for others to see.
Dispute Details: Andrea provided an overview of the dispute details page, explaining the information displayed in the header, consumer information, account information, payment history profile, images, and notes. They also explained the response tabs for E Oscar and system of record.
Next Steps: Khushboo suggested scheduling additional sessions to cover the remaining topics. Andrea and Amanda agreed, and they planned to continue with AUDs and notifications in the next session.
Follow-up tasks:
Next Session Scheduling: Coordinate and set up the next training session for tomorrow at the same time. (Khushboo)

Meeting notes:
Block Notifications Overview: Amanda Gilbert explained the importance of block notifications, which are alerts from the Bureau indicating that certain information has been blocked from a credit report due to identity theft or fraud. She emphasized the need for extra steps when dealing with such notifications.
Definition: Amanda explained that block notifications are alerts from the Bureau indicating that certain information has been blocked from a credit report due to identity theft or fraud. These notifications are crucial as they prevent the re-reporting of fraudulent information.
Importance: Amanda emphasized the importance of block notifications, stating that they are one of the most critical notifications from the Bureau. They require extra steps and careful handling to ensure that fraudulent information is not re-reported.
Handling: When dealing with block notifications, extra steps must be taken, especially when fraud or identity theft is involved. This includes thorough investigation and ensuring that the blocked information is not re-reported.
Difference Between Fraud Disputes and Block Notifications: Khushboo asked about the difference between fraud disputes and block notifications. Amanda clarified that fraud disputes involve specific dispute codes and may not always result in a block, whereas block notifications are direct actions taken by the Bureau to block information due to fraud.
Fraud Disputes: Amanda explained that fraud disputes involve specific dispute codes (e.g., 103 or 104) where the consumer claims fraud. These disputes require investigation and a response but may not always result in a block.
Block Notifications: Block notifications are direct actions taken by the Bureau to block information due to fraud. These notifications indicate that the Bureau has determined the information is fraudulent and has blocked it from being re-reported.
Correlation: Amanda clarified that while fraud disputes and block notifications are not directly correlated, a fraud dispute could result in a block notification if the Bureau determines the information is fraudulent.
Types of Block Notifications: Amanda described the two types of block notifications: block notification ID, which can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, and block trade line, which involves the entire trade line. She explained the data furnisher's obligation to review and accept these notifications.
Block Notification ID: Amanda explained that block notification ID can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, such as a social security number or address. The data furnisher must review and accept these notifications.
Block Trade Line: Block trade line notifications involve the entire trade line, meaning the entire account data set is blocked. These notifications require more investigation and careful handling by the data furnisher.
Data Furnisher's Obligation: The data furnisher's obligation is to review the block notification and ensure that the blocked information is not re-reported. They must accept the notification and prevent the re-reporting of the blocked data.
Block Rescission Request (BRR): Amanda detailed the process of a Block Rescission Request (BRR), which is used when a data furnisher believes a block notification is incorrect. She provided an example of a consumer named Christy and explained the steps to investigate and request the reinsertion of a trade line.
BRR Process: Amanda explained that a Block Rescission Request (BRR) is used when a data furnisher believes a block notification is incorrect. The data furnisher must investigate and provide evidence to request the reinsertion of the trade line.
Example: Amanda provided an example of a consumer named Christy, who was making payments on her account. Despite this, her trade line was blocked. The data furnisher investigated and found no signs of identity theft, leading to a BRR to reinsert the trade line.
Investigation Steps: The investigation steps for a BRR include verifying the consumer's information, checking for signs of identity theft, reviewing the original contract, and ensuring all documentation is correct. If no fraud is found, a BRR is submitted to request reinsertion.
Supporting Documentation for Block Notifications: Sandeep asked if documentation is needed for block notifications. Amanda clarified that while documentation should be preserved internally, there is no way to transmit it back to the Bureau.
360 View and Reporting Options: Amanda mentioned that block notifications and other transactions are part of the 360 view in Sonnet, which groups related transactions together. She also discussed the reporting options available for block notifications, including detail and summary reports.
360 View: Amanda explained that the 360 view in Sonnet groups related transactions together, providing a comprehensive view of all transactions related to a specific account number, including block notifications.
Reporting Options: Amanda discussed the reporting options available for block notifications, including detail reports that provide specific information about each notification and summary reports that offer an overview of notifications by day.
Direct Dispute Dashboard: Tabitha introduced the direct dispute functionality in Sonnet, explaining that direct disputes are those sent directly to the bank or credit union without going through E Oscar. She described the direct dispute dashboard, which shows metrics related to direct disputes.
Direct Disputes: Tabitha explained that direct disputes are those sent directly to the bank or credit union, bypassing E Oscar. These disputes can be received via letter, phone call, or email.
Dashboard Metrics: The direct dispute dashboard in Sonnet shows metrics related to direct disputes, including the number of disputes created and completed today, and disputes within 5 days of the due date.
30-Day Logic: Tabitha mentioned that the same 30-day logic used for acdvs is applied to direct disputes, although some clients may have different timeframes for responding to direct disputes.
Uploading Direct Dispute Documents: Tabitha explained the process of uploading direct dispute documents into Sonnet through the manage files tab. She mentioned that the OCR process extracts necessary information from the documents to create direct disputes in Sonnet.
Upload Process: Tabitha described the process of uploading direct dispute documents into Sonnet through the manage files tab. Users can drag and drop files or browse to select documents for upload.
OCR Process: The OCR process scans the uploaded documents to extract necessary information, such as account numbers and consumer names, to create direct disputes in Sonnet. The status changes to "ready for review" once the OCR process is complete.
Verification: Users review the extracted information in the direct dispute verification form, compare it against the document, and make any necessary adjustments before confirming the information to create the direct dispute.
Verbal Disputes: Khushboo asked about handling verbal disputes. Tabitha explained that verbal disputes can be included in the Step 2 data sent to Sonnet, and the source can be identified as verbal in the direct dispute verification form.
Inclusion in Step 2: Tabitha explained that verbal disputes can be included in the Step 2 data sent to Sonnet. Clients can provide the details of the verbal dispute in the Step 2 file, adhering to the specifications provided.
Source Identification: In the direct dispute verification form, the source of the dispute can be identified as verbal. This allows the system to recognize and process verbal disputes appropriately.
Customizable Dispute Reasons: Tabitha highlighted that the dispute reasons for direct disputes are customizable by the client. She showed where this functionality lives and how clients can maintain their dispute reasons.
Customization: Tabitha explained that clients can customize the dispute reasons for direct disputes. This functionality is set up during implementation and can be maintained by the client's administrative users.
Maintenance: Clients have the ability to maintain and update their dispute reasons as needed.
Multiple Account Numbers in Direct Disputes: Tabitha mentioned that if a consumer disputes multiple accounts in one letter, Sonnet can create a direct dispute for each account number listed. She also explained the workflow for disputes without an account number.
Follow-up tasks:
Workflow Visual Aid: Find and share the workflow visual aid that details the process flow between CRAs, E Oscar, and the data furnisher. (Amanda Gilbert)
Follow-up Meeting: Coordinate and set up a follow-up meeting to cover the remaining topics, including admin functions and direct dispute handling. (Khushboo)

Fraud Disputes: Amanda explained that fraud disputes involve specific dispute codes (e.g., 103 or 104) where the consumer claims fraud. These disputes require investigation and a response but may not always result in a block.
Block Notifications: Block notifications are direct actions taken by the Bureau to block information due to fraud. These notifications indicate that the Bureau has determined the information is fraudulent and has blocked it from being re-reported.
Correlation: Amanda clarified that while fraud disputes and block notifications are not directly correlated, a fraud dispute could result in a block notification if the Bureau determines the information is fraudulent.
Types of Block Notifications: Amanda described the two types of block notifications: block notification ID, which can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, and block trade line, which involves the entire trade line. She explained the data furnisher's obligation to review and accept these notifications.
Block Notification ID: Amanda explained that block notification ID can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, such as a social security number or address. The data furnisher must review and accept these notifications.
Block Trade Line: Block trade line notifications involve the entire trade line, meaning the entire account data set is blocked. These notifications require more investigation and careful handling by the data furnisher.
Data Furnisher's Obligation: The data furnisher's obligation is to review the block notification and ensure that the blocked information is not re-reported. They must accept the notification and prevent the re-reporting of the blocked data.
Block Rescission Request (BRR): Amanda detailed the process of a Block Rescission Request (BRR), which is used when a data furnisher believes a block notification is incorrect. She provided an example of a consumer named Christy and explained the steps to investigate and request the reinsertion of a trade line.
BRR Process: Amanda explained that a Block Rescission Request (BRR) is used when a data furnisher believes a block notification is incorrect. The data furnisher must investigate and provide evidence to request the reinsertion of the trade line.
Example: Amanda provided an example of a consumer named Christy, who was making payments on her account. Despite this, her trade line was blocked. The data furnisher investigated and found no signs of identity theft, leading to a BRR to reinsert the trade line.
Investigation Steps: The investigation steps for a BRR include verifying the consumer's information, checking for signs of identity theft, reviewing the original contract, and ensuring all documentation is correct. If no fraud is found, a BRR is submitted to request reinsertion.
Supporting Documentation for Block Notifications: Sandeep asked if documentation is needed for block notifications. Amanda clarified that while documentation should be preserved internally, there is no way to transmit it back to the Bureau.
360 View and Reporting Options: Amanda mentioned that block notifications and other transactions are part of the 360 view in Sonnet, which groups related transactions together. She also discussed the reporting options available for block notifications, including detail and summary reports.
360 View: Amanda explained that the 360 view in Sonnet groups related transactions together, providing a comprehensive view of all transactions related to a specific account number, including block notifications.
Reporting Options: Amanda discussed the reporting options available for block notifications, including detail reports that provide specific information about each notification and summary reports that offer an overview of notifications by day.

4. How does the rules engine handle custom logic for different customers?
Custom logic is handled by creating individual files for each customer, which are then imported and called based on the company ID. This allows for specific rules and settings to be applied to different customers. 17:23
5. What is the purpose of the dispute queue in the rules engine?
The dispute queue is used to trigger the rules engine to process disputes. When a dispute is entered into the dispute queue, the rules engine picks it up and processes it according to the defined rules and logic. 14:58
6. What are the different statuses a dispute can have, and how do they affect processing?
Disputes can have statuses such as new, active, QA, WIP, and complete. The status determines how the dispute is processed by the rules engine. For example, a dispute in a complete status will not be processed further. 19:24
7. What is the role of the compliance condition code in the rules engine?
The compliance condition code is used to set specific values in the dispute response. It can be customized based on customer settings to use values from the SOR, leave it blank, or use the original dispute value. 33:08
8. How does the rules engine handle no-touch logic?
No-touch logic is defined by the customer and includes criteria for automatically processing disputes without manual intervention. It excludes disputes with images or FCRA relevant information and can be customized further based on specific phrases or conditions. 1:12:03
9. What are the response codes used in the rules engine, and how are they determined?
Response codes such as 01, 02, 03, 07, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are used to indicate the outcome of a dispute. They are determined based on the fields being updated and the specific dispute codes involved. 55:13
10. What is the significance of the random integer function in the AUD rules engine?
The random integer function is used to determine the percentage of disputes sent to QA for manual review. It assigns a number from 0 to 99, and if the number is less than 5, the dispute is sent to QA. 1:27:53

3. How does the XP-2 connector handle account information, and what are its limitations?
Answer: The XP-2 connector uses a straightforward structure to handle account information, primarily focusing on fetching data without submitting it. It does not have scripts and tooling for certain functionalities, and it relies on a CLI utility for parameter translation. 9:38
4. What challenges were faced with the J Exchange interface, and why is it not widely used?
Answer: The J Exchange interface faced challenges in retrieving specific fields like payment history profiles, which are crucial for its functionality. Due to these limitations, it is not widely implemented, and customers are encouraged to integrate with the system via API instead. 46:24
5. What is the significance of the refresh process in the interfaces, and how is it implemented?
Answer: The refresh process ensures that the most recent data from the customer's system of record is available. It runs daily at a specified time, updating the data to reflect any changes made in the customer's system. This process is crucial for maintaining data accuracy. 1:30:47
6. How do the SIM Exchange and Correlation interfaces differ in their initialization and data retrieval methods?
Answer: The SIM Exchange interface initializes by loading all company properties from the database, and it fails if the setup is incorrect. In contrast, the Correlation interface dynamically fetches configuration data during runtime, making it more flexible and lightweight. 1:33:57
7. What are the common customization requests from customers, and how are they handled in the interfaces?
Answer: Common customization requests include specific data transformations, account status rules, and payment history formatting. These requests are handled by implementing custom logic within the service methods for each customer, ensuring their unique requirements are met. 1:16:54
8. What technologies and tools are used for logging and debugging in the J Exchange interface?
Answer: The J Exchange interface uses extensive logging to capture requests, responses, and errors. This logging is required for certification and debugging purposes, ensuring that all interactions with the interface are well-documented and traceable. 52:38
9. What are the key differences between the XP-2 and SIM Exchange connectors in terms of their structure and functionality?
Answer: The XP-2 connector is simpler, focusing on fetching data without submitting it, and lacks certain scripts and tooling. The SIM Exchange connector is more complex, with multiple endpoints for different data types and a structured initialization process that relies on database configurations. 9:38
10. How do the interfaces handle session management and authentication for secure data access?
Answer: Interfaces like Correlation use session IDs to manage authentication, ensuring secure data access. These session IDs are refreshed frequently to prevent expiration and maintain a secure connection with the customer's system. 1:45:01
These questions and answers cover the key topics discussed in the meeting, providing a comprehensive overview of the interfaces, their functionalities, challenges, and customization requirements.

July 16, 2025, 5:28PM

Manjunath S started transcription

Amanda Gilbert   0:10
Are we recording this?

James Maki   0:13
Yes, we are recording now Majhi. Justin Majhi just started.

Amanda Gilbert   0:14
OK.
Just making sure.

James Maki   0:19
Oh, and then I made it.
I do actually see what Andrew was talking about with the receipts.
So there's some out there on the server from today.
And so he's talking about like, all these account numbers, I guess should all be like the same length, is what he's looking for.
So like some of these like delete zeros are being dropped off.

Amanda Gilbert   0:42
Mm hmm.

James Maki   0:43
But it's not from one specific Bureau, so I did pull up a couple of those.
So there's like one from Experian and one from TransUnion.
So it's not dependent on anything like that.
But but this is what he's talking about, though, is.

Amanda Gilbert   0:58
Yeah, I see.
I don't know what he wants us to do about it because he's got that other one right to stop the truncating.
And now there's this one.

James Maki   1:10
Yeah, yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   1:11
And if he had it his way, he's gonna say pat it with zeros so that it gets to the 10 digits.
Like what are we doing here?
Are we padding or do you want us to just not truncate anymore?
Send it as is.
So what are we doing?
He needs to figure it out.
Or we're gonna start charging him.

James Maki   1:33
Yes.
Alright, I just wanna show that real fast.

Amanda Gilbert   1:47
Can we look?
At the problem 23291 real quick like there's only a couple tickets open still.
But Supriya one of them doesn't look like it's related.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:10
Oh yes.
Oh, American Airlines.

Amanda Gilbert   2:18
Nope. Figure.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:22
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   2:24
Why did you associate it with this problem ticket?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:32
I'm not sure.
I think I gave all of them at one shot, maybe in that it went by mistake.

James Maki   2:44
I can either share your screen also so we can see the ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:51
Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   3:10
So this one looks to be like a completely separate.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   3:15
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   3:15
Question. So it should not be associated with this problem.
Right. Would you agree with that?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   3:30
Yes, I removed that.

Amanda Gilbert   3:33
OK.
So this one should be separate.
And he's just asking a couple questions.
So Supriya I would fix your comment to them and and I would just say.
My apologies, I associated your request with an unrelated issue.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   3:59
Who?
Yes, I will do that.

Amanda Gilbert   4:04
OK. And then just say I'm working on getting you the answers to your questions about Doctor Notifications.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   4:10
OK.

James Maki   4:17
Oh, are there still tickets open from the from the server being down from that issue?
Like, are are those incidents? Are all those still open?

Amanda Gilbert   4:27
So there's only a couple that I'm seeing now.
That was one that we just went through.
There's one for eight ACU, and then there's one impending.
I can share my screen.
I got it up.
So here it is.
But I wanted James.
I wanted to make sure we got everything attached.
To this, so Supriya Manju. I just want to make sure you guys like when you're working through these tickets and you're you. I you got the problem right? Supriya, you did the right thing by creating like an individual problem that kind of like is your main problem and.
Then you attach everything to it.
It's really important that you attach to the right problem, because.
'Cause like if worth if you guys are thinking like you're getting all these tickets in, right.
And you're like, Oh my gosh, we have a problem.
Oh, there's 16 incidents attached to it that makes it a high priority item, right?
There's multiple tickets associated with one problem, so the dev team should focus on that because that means that you can close 16 tickets if they can resolve it.
So it's just important that we associate properly.
See what this is?
So.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:58
No, actually they were asking about the, you know, is the image file.

Amanda Gilbert   6:05
Yes. So why did you tell them that?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:08
Yeah. And later I have corrected that.

Amanda Gilbert   6:12
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:13
And sent them the correct response.

Amanda Gilbert   6:17
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:21
And again, they came back.

Amanda Gilbert   6:46
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:51
OK.
So they are informing or like.

Amanda Gilbert   7:09
Maybe this is referring to 711, right?
You said there was no innovis files, OK.
They're saying there may not be a Step 2 file. OK, so maybe what you should do is.
Check their data files.
And you would.
I would check them through like this data files view here.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:33
Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   7:34
And I would check them everyday. I would just go through them like this.
Here I'm going to go back to the 11th.
I'm going to look.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:41
Learn.

Amanda Gilbert   7:41
They only got a step one right, so they should have gotten a step three if they completed disputes.
OK.
So they got one on Monday, so that would have contained everything and then they got, they got 2 on Monday.
That looks like when you were working the ticket, and then there's two on.
One is probably AUD S, though, so there's two on the 15th, so it looks like they're good.
I I think we've got everything.

James Maki   8:16
Yes, there's nothing.
Waiting for data.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:20
MMM.

Amanda Gilbert   8:23
So I would say for this one that you could tell them Supriya that we confirm the data file exchange is.
Running as expected.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:37
Hmm.

Amanda Gilbert   8:37
Since Monday.
All of the image and all of the batch files have been sent, and those that you have sent we have received.
Please let us know if there's anything else we can help you with and then you should be able to get rid of this ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:54
Yeah, I will do that.

Amanda Gilbert   8:56
OK.

James Maki   8:58
So just to add an extra layer to this like part of the reason that we don't receive a Step 2 file every day from them is because they're also exchange client.
And so if I remember right, these guys are kind of a hybrid like where they're kind of doing some of both.

Amanda Gilbert   9:08
Oh yeah.

James Maki   9:15
And so that's why we don't always get to Step 2 file back.
That's because if I remember right, I could.
I could be wrong.
I might be confused with someone else, but I think they might be working at a two different systems.
I think is why that's a thing. And so I think like the.
Just so two files from like a different, uh, a different system of record. I think that's what Andrea told me.

Amanda Gilbert   10:06
OK.
What else?
I'm still sharing, but you guys are welcome to share and pull up the ticket. Follow along.

Saravanabhavan S   10:26
Umm.
Hello.
Amanda. So we have received one more acvda error, the same 22999 we forgot for self bank.
So even hello.

Amanda Gilbert   10:50
OK.

James Maki   10:50
Yeah, we hear you. We hear you.

Saravanabhavan S   10:52
Yeah. So even I tried to date that one that duplicate things still they are getting this error.

James Maki   11:05
All right. So so there's no duplicate there. So check the other.

Saravanabhavan S   11:08
No, there is no problem.

James Maki   11:10
So check the other table that we were looking at response queue.

Amanda Gilbert   11:14
MMM.

Saravanabhavan S   11:17
OK, we have to check in the response queue.

James Maki   11:20
Yeah.
So. So. So in your in your query.
We're going to change the table name change that change that from E Oscar response, change that to response queue.
Alright and look there.
And there's her duplicate.

Saravanabhavan S   11:53
OK.
So it can be duplicates from 2 table also.

James Maki   11:58
Yes.

Saravanabhavan S   12:00
OK.
OK.
So this one Amanda.

James Maki   12:18
Alright, can you?
Can you click on the person on your on the right side of your screen?
Like the like the profile? Yeah, there just so we can read the tickets a little bit easier.

Amanda Gilbert   12:32
So this one I.
Follow up to so. If you go back to to. Yeah. To go back to that ticket.
And I think.
So read the last couple comments.
And it just went wrong.
OK so.

Saravanabhavan S   12:53
So.

Amanda Gilbert   12:55
There.

Saravanabhavan S   12:57
So when choosing last six months, I'm getting still getting error message.
Any other options such as 30 days works?

Amanda Gilbert   13:07
Yep.

Saravanabhavan S   13:09
So when they are trying to push that for six months, they are getting error.
So we don't have like that much of capacity to get six months.

Amanda Gilbert   13:14
Mm H.

Saravanabhavan S   13:22
Dispute summary report maybe?

Amanda Gilbert   13:27
There's two things here, right?
Number one, I thought there was a fix in that.
Didn't time out the page as quickly while it was waiting on results so that they would be able to run a longer report.
So we need to confirm with Dev.
Like what did you actually fix?
And then the second part is the client.
We said, hey, there's been a fix and the client came back and they said, well, it's still not working for us. And we said, OK, thanks for the confirmation and just close the ticket.
So that's why it got reopened.

Saravanabhavan S   14:08
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   14:09
Did you see that where we did that?
Yeah, you said.
Thanks for the confirmation, Armand.
You did, but right above that the client is saying like, hey, it's still not working.
So I don't know.

Saravanabhavan S   14:24
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   14:25
Did did we put a fix in to fix something else and we assumed that it was going to fix this.
Or did they actually fix this because it's not standard for us to allow a client to run a huge report like that because it's like not going to generate for them?

Saravanabhavan S   14:47
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   14:48
So that's what I want to know.
Like, did we really fix it?
Was that the intended fix or we just grouping this together with everything else and this is a separate issue?

Saravanabhavan S   15:28
Hello.

Amanda Gilbert   15:31
Yes.

Saravanabhavan S   15:32
OK.
OK then.

Amanda Gilbert   15:34
So so this is what you need to do.

Saravanabhavan S   15:39
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   15:40
You need to look at the original DevOps links DevOps link in the first task and then you need to reach out to the dev team and you need to understand what they think they fixed.

Saravanabhavan S   15:46
OK.
OK.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   15:57
So ask them to tell you what they fixed and then let me know.

Saravanabhavan S   15:57
OK.
OK.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   16:03
And we'll decide what to do next.

Saravanabhavan S   16:05
OK.
This one Amanda that was here.
He's returning data easily, working less than 50%.

Amanda Gilbert   16:27
OK.
So this one needs.

Saravanabhavan S   16:30
So.

Amanda Gilbert   16:33
To go to Dev with that feedback.
And.
I would say.
That you need a user story. So create a user story, put it in Sprint 101.
And then make sure it's tied to this.
Task.

Saravanabhavan S   17:15
So we have to create for the useful story.

Amanda Gilbert   17:18
Yes.
Not this one.
The possible one meets the user story.
This one.

Saravanabhavan S   17:36
Hey, Samantha.
So actually the dev op access was we are not able to access the dev OPS.
So we getting a trial was done. So we not be able to create.

Amanda Gilbert   17:52
OK.
Well, can you go directly to DevOps?
It's taking so long.

Saravanabhavan S   19:33
Metal tube issue and things.

Amanda Gilbert   19:36
OK.
Just go to the top and hit that little plus symbol.
Right there.
Where it says sonnet on the left side.
Go to the left.

Saravanabhavan S   19:52
This one I want.

Amanda Gilbert   19:53
Go to the left.
Your other left left all the way to the other side of the screen.
Keep going.
You're almost there.
See the little plus where it says sonnet.
Alright.
Do you see the little plus symbol to your left?
Just look right to your left where that purple S is next to sauna. Keep going.
You're so close.
There you go. Hit that.
New work item user story.
User story.
OK.
Create a title and your title should be like.
OCR improvement.
Need improvement needed based on user feedback.
And 1:01.
Perfect.
And then you might want to reference the ticket number in the subject. Also you can just put like zdt and then put the ticket number and then.
23192.
192 perfect.
And then I think for the description you can just.
You can just copy what the client says.
In this case, they said it pretty good.
We'll put it in the right user story format.
But just so see where it says description.

Saravanabhavan S   22:31
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   22:34
Yeah, just expand that and then just copy and paste it right there and then you can tell the client that we've assigned it to the development team.
I'll wait for you.

Saravanabhavan S   22:45
S.

Amanda Gilbert   23:27
That'll work.
So save it.
OK.
And now it disappeared.
So we have to find it.
So put the search for the ticket number there at the top where it says search.
Hit enter.
No where did it go.
You might have to refresh.
See if I can find it.
We might have to go to the Sprint Board 101 'cause. That's where you placed it.
Maybe it's there.
Yeah, so I found it.
So go to sprints on the left side.
All right.
And then once it loads, change your iteration to 101.
You see it right there at the top where it says iteration.
Yeah. Change it to 101.
Change your.
Where it says support up at the top right there, change it to Sonnet team.
OK.
Click backlog so you're viewing the task board, which is difficult to view. So hit the backlog tab.
There you go.
All right. So with the one we just created is #7.
So if you right click on it.
For that.
So you can copy it two ways.
You can go to the three the the ellipses in the top right and you can click there and hit copy link.
Perfect. Now go put it on the ticket.
So this would be direct.

Saravanabhavan S   26:05
Who was in?

Amanda Gilbert   26:10
There's no direct here.
OK.
So I guess dispute management, which is everything.
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   26:56
So priority is not locking. Amanda. Amanda.

Amanda Gilbert   27:01
OK.
So you're gonna tell her hi.
Thank you for the feedback.
We have sent this over to our development team so that they can work to improve your OCR results.

Saravanabhavan S   27:07
Yeah.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   27:15
It is assigned.
And currently scheduled for resolution.
You can say.
Mid August, so you can just say approximately mid August 'cause we put it in the next Sprint so.

Saravanabhavan S   27:35
Mid August.

Amanda Gilbert   27:38
Yep.
My response queue has OK.
This one is the same thing as KIRO.
This should.
Be something that makes you go. Oh, something's wrong.
So what did you do for KIRO? Was that you?

Saravanabhavan S   28:34
The response queue.

Amanda Gilbert   28:38
There was just a ticket we were talking about at the beginning of the call. That was KIRO.
Right. I don't know who that was though.

Saravanabhavan S   28:47
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   28:48
OK.
So the exact same thing for them.

Saravanabhavan S   28:53
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   28:55
You you should just be able to go check and it should. It should be submitted now.
So who can walk in through how to go check that?
Who did the KIRO ticket?

James Maki   29:08
So pretty I had that one, I think.

Saravanabhavan S   30:09
Well, my dispute was not there, Amanda. So it was resolved, right?

Amanda Gilbert   30:13
The what wasn't there?
Did you go to the response queue?
So there's nothing there.
Yep. So you can just tell him everything has been cleared out while you're there.

Saravanabhavan S   30:29
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   30:35
I would check his there's two companies for M and TI would check them both.
Since you're already there.

Saravanabhavan S   30:45
To company in Spain, so we have to go.

Amanda Gilbert   30:48
Yeah.
Perfect. So you check them both. You can just let them know.
I checked both and.
The response queue is clear. Bam.

Saravanabhavan S   31:16
And.
That's all from my.

Amanda Gilbert   31:54
All right, we have to drop.
I gotta drop for another call, but we have another one on Friday and I think we made good progress.
So snack stack em up for Friday.

Saravanabhavan S   32:02
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   32:05
Let's blow through them, just like we did now, OK?

Saravanabhavan S   32:08
OK.

Manjunath S   32:09
Show reminder.

Amanda Gilbert   32:10
See ya.
Thank you. Good job.

Saravanabhavan S   32:11

July 21, 2025, 5:03PM
2h 13m 6s

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri started transcription

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:04
Having a conversation with Liddy that this is working as expected and what they're expecting would be an enhancement.
And.
We are struggling to communicate in which IT will be convincing for The customer to understand what what we are trying to say.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:27
Thanks.

Amanda Gilbert   0:28
OK, so it's the mid Florida ticket. Let me look. I see it on your screen, but I have a hard time following when you're scrolling, so I'm just gonna look on my screen.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:39
Yeah, I'm not stable when I'm presenting. I know that I've got that feedback many times, I know.

Amanda Gilbert   0:41
You're OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:52
1.
Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   1:29
So you're talking specifically about 22046 only, correct?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   1:38
I guess The related incidents are also The same because on DevOps I believe nothing has been done. One second, I was going through IT 8119.

Amanda Gilbert   1:55
Mhm.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   1:57
Because I did not see any communication, but I see directly. Uh.
Enhancement request where The child parenting parent child link linked dispute should follow The same queue and IT should give what do you call?
There was additional information there. I should give A. note indicating why IT was sent to The QAQ.

Amanda Gilbert   2:28
I see, yeah.
So I'm.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   2:37
Because I.
Yes, please go ahead. Sorry.

Amanda Gilbert   2:39
Mm-hmm. I'm creating another one because it looks like it wasn't addressed fully.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   2:46
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   2:46
I remember meeting with him about the disputes that are going to QA because I was under the impression they they were all going to QA and he said only the children were going to QA and that's how it was set up.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   2:53
Mhm.

Amanda Gilbert   3:02
So I created a successor user story for an enhancement, but I don't see where the grouping is addressed.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   3:12
Even I did not see that.

Amanda Gilbert   3:15
I don't either. I'm putting it in 101 and I'll give you a new ID, so just a second.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   3:21
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   4:05
OK, 8503.
And I'm checking the two incidents there.
OK, same thing.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:08
Then I was looking at this one as well. Can we move to next one?

Amanda Gilbert   5:14
Yeah.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:15
8159.
Where they wanted to copy The custom queue from The consumer queue from 24200 to this organization 24201.

Amanda Gilbert   5:31
OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:32
I see this year.
Not there.

Amanda Gilbert   5:49
OK.
So there's two things.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:51
This is not.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   5:54
There's two things that have to happen.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:58
Mhm.

Amanda Gilbert   5:58
For a custom queue, the first thing is that it has to be built in the rules engine.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   6:04
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   6:04
The second thing is you have to build the queues for the UI, so either they're not built in the rules engine or they're not built in the UI, or both.
So we need we can find out. I can show you how to find out or you can just ask the person who did the task.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   6:19
Uh.
I have pinged Vinay basically for it.

Amanda Gilbert   6:30
Mhm.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   6:32
8159.
I was already on it. My bad, sorry.
I'm waiting for him to ping me. I'm just waiting for his confirmation because there isn't any information which I can see here. There are many linked items here there.
So I'll guess I'll wait for him to get back to me.

Amanda Gilbert   7:03
OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   7:05
And what was The other item? This one again, yeah, this is again related to rules engine where we said that IT is fixed, but The customer got back stating that IT is not fixed.

Amanda Gilbert   7:06
Mm.
100.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   7:24
So multiple items in this DevOps #8240.

Amanda Gilbert   7:33
OK, so.
We so this one was closed. The original was closed. The client came back and said no, it's not fixed.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   7:43
Mm-hmm. No.

Amanda Gilbert   7:51
OK.
What was the number for that one? The ticket number?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   7:59
22670.

Amanda Gilbert   8:15
OK, so a couple things #1.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:18
Mhm.

Amanda Gilbert   8:21
Anytime we change their no touch, we should be turning off their no touch.
So Vinay should be doing that. Whether or not he's doing it, I don't know. But we make the change. So we make the change. We turn off the no touch. They validate the change. Once it's good, we turn it back on. It looks like we left it on.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:28
OK.
Mhm.

Amanda Gilbert   8:43
Which is. Does that make any sense to you?
I'm trying to make sure we're on the same page.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:47
So The check.
I got IT that you are saying that whenever we are deploying any, making any changes related to no touch, no touch needs to be turned off. We make The changes, The customer validates IT and then we turn on The no touch, correct. So by keeping IT on, does IT mean that The changes never got into effect?

Amanda Gilbert   8:57
Yes.
Yes.
No, it means the customer wasn't able to validate the changes.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   9:14
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   9:16
So it doesn't make sense for us to change automation and leave the automation on, right? They have to check it. They have to make sure because otherwise we can be held liable for issues. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to be liable for a client not being able to validate automation.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   9:16
OK.
And.

Amanda Gilbert   9:35
So that's the first thing, and that would be on the dev's responsibility because they're the ones they know when they're going to make the change.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   9:39
Um.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   9:44
Um.
We should leave the work item that is closed as closed, but yeah, that's fine. The end for it is what I meant. We should leave it as is, but I think we need to.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   9:50
It is resolved, not closed.
Mm-hmm.

Amanda Gilbert   10:00
Do a new one.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   10:02
Mhm.
OK, I will do that.

Amanda Gilbert   10:08
All right. And make sure hold, hold on, let me let me do it because I want to make sure that it's attached to the original one, which is 8240. I just want it to be a successor of 8240. So if you can, if you can make sure that that happens.
So we yeah, just do the one above it add link cause yeah right there and then new and then just select successor.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   10:26
OK.
It will not let me copy anything, right?

Amanda Gilbert   10:52
What do you mean?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   10:55
It will pick up the details automatically or I wanted to copy the details.

Amanda Gilbert   11:00
No, it's. You'll have to copy the details. It's completely separate.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   11:33
We would have to change the due date again as well for this putting a due date there because I remember while prioritization we did add that so we should accommodate it in the IT in the current sprint or the next one. Ideally I guess this sprint.

Amanda Gilbert   11:39
Mhm.
And we don't have any room in this spread. There's zero space, so you'll have to put it in the next one, yeah.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   11:55
OK, so I'm not adding anything.
101.

Amanda Gilbert   12:33
Yes.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:09
OK.
I can.
So any more I wanted to talk about?
I have to get back to this customer.
No, I guess just two.
I don't have anything else. These these were the only one which I wanted to talk.

Amanda Gilbert   13:47
OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:49
James is there.

Amanda Gilbert   13:51
Oh, nice.
Hello, James.

James Maki   13:54
Yep, I'm here.
What's up, guys?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:59
Are you not well?

James Maki   14:02
I'm good.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   14:07
Alright, stage is yours, Supriya Manju s s.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:18
OK.
Let me share my story.
Um.
So.
Amanda. So I have asked him like, oh, he was getting this error.
Call 3170.

Amanda Gilbert   14:49
All right.
Um, James, we could pull up the dispute and in sonnet Supriya.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   15:18
So.
Sorry.

Amanda Gilbert   15:29
Will you go look at the dispute in Sonnet?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   15:32
Yes.
We chat and we rock that too.
Error after means in the account history we checked and we can see that the correction was made after the error came. So that's what we have said. The mind is telling.

Amanda Gilbert   16:59
Oh, what was the response code that they used?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   17:06
23.

Amanda Gilbert   17:07
Hmm.
Can you look at the history really quick?
OK.
OK.
Did they change the response code at any point in time?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   18:09
Window history.

Amanda Gilbert   18:11
Yeah, do a control F to and just search for response code.
Yeah, so that's why.
Um.
It I think the issue is resolved because James, I think this was related to remember that error that was coming for response code 03 when it was a consumer identity the dispute.

James Maki   18:54
Uh, vaguely.

Amanda Gilbert   18:55
Well, they changed it from an 03 to a 23, so that's why I think it's related.

James Maki   19:06
OK, that makes sense.

Amanda Gilbert   19:07
S.
So I think for this one you can tell them that um.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   19:10
I.

Amanda Gilbert   19:17
It was a bug related. I don't want to say a bug. How do we phrase that? You can say.
Um, we believe the development team has addressed this.
And if you continue to see this error, please let us know.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   19:42
Stop.
Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, Amanda, so for this Dr. notifications.

Amanda Gilbert   21:03
Mhm.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   21:04
So I have uh corresponded them this. So what's the next step?
OK. Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   21:40
OK, let's go look at the transaction inside of Sonnet.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:12
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   22:27
You have to change the type that you're searching for.
OK.
So this one.
Is you see the type how it says Dr. Notification ID?
So that means that there may not be a specific account number associated with this.
But basically the Bureau is saying that they deleted.
Some consumer information. Scroll down. Let's see what they deleted.
So they deleted the address. See that in the middle.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   23:33
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   23:37
Keep scrolling down. Let's see what else they have.
OK, that's it.
So that address has been deleted. There is not an account number. They have to do the look up by the consumer information.
So let's, um, back out of it and then let's go back to the ticket.
OK, so.
You can tell Ryan. You can say Ryan, this is a Dr. Notification ID.
Which is related to consumer information only.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   24:52
Who?

Amanda Gilbert   24:55
Period. The CRA.
Has deleted.
Some consumer information.
In accordance with their internal policy or IP.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:26
Hmm?

Amanda Gilbert   25:27
And then period. And then you can say these are not always associated with an account number when they're specifically related to consumer information only.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:30
Yes.
M.
These are not always associated with.

Amanda Gilbert   25:55
With an account number.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   26:02
Who?

Amanda Gilbert   26:05
Especially when they are Dr. Notification ID.
As those are related to consumer information usually.
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   26:58
OK.
Is this enough?

Amanda Gilbert   27:08
That's good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   27:26
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   27:34
All right.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   27:36
Okay. Uh So this one in the dev environment, I have created his account.
So I think this is his connection issue maybe.

Amanda Gilbert   27:53
Um, there's a separate white listing that needs to be done.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   27:53
Damn.

Amanda Gilbert   28:01
James, can James, can you help with that? Because this is in dev and it's got that extra white listing.

James Maki   28:14
Are you talking about like for the firewall?

Amanda Gilbert   28:15
Yeah.

James Maki   28:18
OK.
I can. We are also starting to escalate that to the Pavana IT guys also, right? They're they're handling all the firewall stuff, but yes, I can.

Amanda Gilbert   28:30
OK.

James Maki   28:36
Handle it. Am I? You know, I'm saying there's not an IP address here on the ticket, right? Am I overlooking it?

Amanda Gilbert   28:39
Do do they know also like?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   28:48
Yes.

James Maki   28:51
OK. All right. So I know we had one.
On the setup tickets.
Alright, uh, if you go over to the dev environment, uh, there should be an IP address that's already whitelisted for him.
What uh?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   29:16
Please.
Oh.

James Maki   30:00
Oh yeah, these were the guys that gave us the 192 address.
OK, uh.
So they they gave us like an internal IP address, so the one that's whitelisted for them.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   30:16
Yes, this one.

James Maki   30:17
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's not actually like a valid IP address. So I think that's what the problem is. So just just ask them to like verify what the IP address is that they're connecting from.
Uh, like their their public IP.
And then uh, and then we can add that in the firewall.
Because that's not a that's not a public facing IP address, so that's not the one that we need to whitelist.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   30:39
OK.
Yes.

James Maki   30:59
And do you guys know what what I mean when I say that that's not a public IP address? Like do you guys know about the 192.168 IPS?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   31:07
Yes, means that one will be not applicable for all users.

James Maki   31:08
OK.
Well, it's not even that. It just means like it's it's not even public facing like that's not the IP address that's facing towards the Internet. So that that's like a.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   31:21
Hmm.

James Maki   31:24
It's it's like an internal IP address, like it's it's not quite the same as like the 10 dot IPS.
But it's but it's sort of similar to that.
But so anyone, anytime someone sends you an IP address that starts with 192.168, that's not a public IP address and that's not gonna get them.
Uh, connected to to Sonnet.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   32:40
OK.
So this one actually I didn't understand. I have asked him for the whatever subscriber code they have created.
So.

James Maki   33:20
Can you can you click on the on the person the profile icon on the right side?
On the right side, just like close that profile part.
Yeah, on the right, click on the person.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   33:41
Yeah.
I.

James Maki   33:43
On the far right, like actually all the way to the right.

Amanda Gilbert   33:48
The little symbol, The little person symbol.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   33:49
No.

James Maki   33:51
Like above the apps, above the apps icon. Like no further to the right. Yeah, yeah, the one. The person above that. Yes, there, just so we can see the ticket better.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   33:53
Yeah.
This one.
You said to maximize the OK.

Amanda Gilbert   34:07
So this one should be.
This one is something you can do by yourself O if you Scroll back to the very first communication.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:14
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   34:20
Um, they say we have a new subscriber code. We need to add it.
The only thing that we're really missing from their first reply is the Bureau, because we have to select the Bureau.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:35
Mhm.

Amanda Gilbert   34:36
But if you'll Scroll down to where Gayla replies right there. Oh, one more just below that you replied and then right there. So she refers to to a novice.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:48
Hello.

Amanda Gilbert   34:52
So that subscriber code is for Innovus, so let's go add that.
So you'll go into Sonnet.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   35:01
Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   35:04
You'll go to the company admin.
OK. And there you go. And then first thing that we're going to do is go down to Innovus and expand that.
And the reason why we're just double checking is because we don't want to add it twice accidentally.
When we are downloading, if we don't have the subscriber code here, we will add it when we download if it doesn't exist. So just click on the little arrow down there on the right side.
And let's see if that is in the list currently.
And it's not, so you're going to add it at the top.
So you're going to select the Bureau name. You're going to put the subscriber code in.
Remove the space at the end. There you go and then save and then you can let her know that it's been added.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   36:41
OK.
Yes, Amanda, I was having only those. So this one, so the rule updates. So do I need to?

Amanda Gilbert   37:18
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   37:26
Oh, create a new DevOps or do we have any?

Amanda Gilbert   37:30
Yes, it needs a new DevOps.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   37:31
Existing demo.
OK, I will do that.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   37:41
Supriya Manju s s for any rules related query. If it's a new one or update to the rules engine or anything, you should straight away click a demo. You need to follow the SOP which I have shared with you all.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   37:47
Who?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   37:57
Especially for tickets request which use case for which you have to directly create DevOps. If you have any doubts for that, we can have a session again on that. We'll have it OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   38:11
No, it's not.
OK, so that's it from and like I don't have anything else.

Amanda Gilbert   38:22
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   38:51
Saravana, you're on mute.

Saravanabhavan S   39:01
Hello.

Amanda Gilbert   39:02
Hello.

Saravanabhavan S   39:03
Yeah, so Amanda ticket number 23344. So then they are two users like whenever they are putting into work in progress still it even a active list. So it makes other on the list to place on the board.
So, but they didn't give the any ID, so not ID. So we need ID to investigate, right?

Amanda Gilbert   39:26
Yeah, so.
That's really the like. I've never heard of the send to whip not working ever.
And every user should have access, so I would ask for specific IDs to investigate.

Saravanabhavan S   39:45
OK.
OK. So we have to investigate in both these two companies like RSC and Cyclone.

Amanda Gilbert   39:52
Um.
I What are we doing? I don't think there's anything to investigate right now. I think we prompt them for details, so we need more information. So I would just say we need some more information to.

Saravanabhavan S   40:00
OK.
E.

Amanda Gilbert   40:13
Provide some Sonnet ID's where the user sent them to WIP and they remained inactive so we can investigate.

Saravanabhavan S   40:13
The.
Yes.
OK.
OK, so and.
So same in Barclays, so they also having multiple users accessing same dispute at same time so.
From their side, they know.

Amanda Gilbert   40:42
So we have. Sorry, go ahead.

Saravanabhavan S   40:46
From their side they share that WAP but when I try to research on that I can see like work in progress to complete only.
So may they may there may be bug from their side.

Amanda Gilbert   41:06
Um.
I don't think so. I think that there may be.
This is related to disputes, not walking, right? Something different.

Saravanabhavan S   41:22
Uh.
Like they are two agents, so if one agents like accessing the same same dispute at the same time, they're having issues.

Amanda Gilbert   41:29
Mhm.
Right, so it's dispute's not walking because normally s s.
If I'm in a dispute, you can't go into that dispute and we refer to that as dispute locking. So it's locked. It locks everyone else out and I believe we have a problem ticket for this same issue.

Saravanabhavan S   42:02
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   42:04
So see if you can find the problem ticket for disputes not locking.

Saravanabhavan S   42:11
OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   42:14
I can help with that. It's in the it's in the sheet which SharePoint sheet which I shared which Chandan shared. But Amanda that DevOps ID is listed as deployed and fixed.

Saravanabhavan S   42:14
So I can't stop.

Amanda Gilbert   42:28
OK, it's not. So I is it really deployed? That's what I want to know.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   42:37
OK, give me a few minutes. I'll share that as it's carry on. I'll share that. Let me get back.

Saravanabhavan S   42:42
Yeah.
So shall I just link this to the problem ticket?

Amanda Gilbert   42:50
Yes.

Saravanabhavan S   42:51
OK.
And one more so we have done that Renton builds on last Friday. So they are asking yes they don't have a sort of interrogation integrations. So the so they asking like remove the current disputes from and schedule the download from.

Amanda Gilbert   43:06
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Saravanabhavan S   43:15
Ask her.

Amanda Gilbert   43:15
Mhm.

Saravanabhavan S   43:17
Asking which time um can take place.

Amanda Gilbert   43:23
So we have a DevOps item for this one also. So if you Scroll down just a little bit, you'll see there's a DevOps item.
Maybe.

Saravanabhavan S   43:37
Noon.

Amanda Gilbert   43:37
No.
Um, can you click on Selfbank to see all of their other tickets?

Saravanabhavan S   43:49
So 8206 we have one DevOps, another DevOps bank.

Amanda Gilbert   43:57
Um.
Scroll down just a little bit.
Hmm, they should have. There is one. Let me find it.
So there is a DevOps work item.
Already. Let me see if I can find it.

Saravanabhavan S   44:15
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   44:19
Um.

Saravanabhavan S   44:19
So we have one existing DevOps 8206 for cell back.

Amanda Gilbert   44:28
8206.

Saravanabhavan S   44:29
Yes.

Amanda Gilbert   44:35
Yeah, that's the one that should be attached.

Saravanabhavan S   44:38
OK.
M.

Amanda Gilbert   45:52
OK, so for now.
You found the link. It looks like it did not get moved over in Sprint, so it probably just dropped and.

Saravanabhavan S   46:05
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   46:08
I went ahead and created another story in 101 with this.

Saravanabhavan S   46:16
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   46:16
But you can still find it. So for now there's another thing that we can do. The disputes are getting stuck in new status and so we need to move the disputes to active status.

Saravanabhavan S   46:30
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   46:31
Do you know how to do that?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:13
Uh, Sarona, that update.

Saravanabhavan S   47:14
Oh, it's this.
This one time.

Amanda Gilbert   47:22
Um.

Manjunath S   47:22
Yes, let insert into that query.

Amanda Gilbert   47:28
Yes.
You can use that one, but you you'll need to change the Sonnet status from active to new, but you can use both of those.

Saravanabhavan S   47:36
Uh.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   47:50
So delete that whatever you're typing, delete it.

Saravanabhavan S   47:55
Uh, just I'm putting a no, no, no, no.

Amanda Gilbert   48:00
OK, so see where you have active already there.

Saravanabhavan S   48:05
So we have to give you.

Amanda Gilbert   48:08
Yeah, just replace active with new.

Saravanabhavan S   48:11
OK.
So if we run these two queries.

Amanda Gilbert   48:22
Yeah, I would resave this query. I would take out this one, but like don't take it out, don't delete it. Just change where you have active, change it to new.
On both because we were doing something different when we changed these. So for this purpose where we're trying to move stuff from active to new.

Saravanabhavan S   48:35
OK.
Thank you.

Amanda Gilbert   48:46
You'll just run these two queries and you're referencing new status.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   49:07
I've pasted the disputes not locking DevOps in the chart.

Amanda Gilbert   49:13
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   49:50
Where else come to them?

Amanda Gilbert   49:53
I'm sorry.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   49:55
Go to the front, go inside the application and see whether you can see disputes in new status, right? Whenever you make any changes, try to validate first or whenever you guys are communicating.

Saravanabhavan S   49:56
So.
Yes.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   50:12
Any fixes to customer validated first?

Saravanabhavan S   51:00
It is updating in rules engine, right?

Amanda Gilbert   51:03
Yeah, it looks like it's still running.

Saravanabhavan S   51:07
So it wants everything as to false.

Amanda Gilbert   51:08
Sick.
Yeah, but if you go to the the client side of Sonnet, you should see the number has changed.

Saravanabhavan S   51:42
Yes, the numbers has been changed.

Amanda Gilbert   51:46
You said yes, it has.

Saravanabhavan S   51:51
It was around like 267 before. Now it's changed to 0.

Amanda Gilbert   51:56
Oh, nice. OK, that's good. The other way that you can check is if you go to their look ahead.
On the left menu, yeah, that one right there. And what we're looking for is new. So I don't see any new. Do you see any new?

Saravanabhavan S   52:17
No.

Amanda Gilbert   52:18
Yeah, it's a different color too. So I think what you did worked and you can tell them that it's good. What I would expect. So you fixed it for today, right? Tomorrow they're going to have the same thing that's going to happen.

Saravanabhavan S   52:20
M.
Yeah.

Amanda Gilbert   52:37
We're going to download. The disputes are going to hang out new until dev does their part.

Saravanabhavan S   52:43
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   52:43
Um, you can expect that the client is going to reach out consistently.

Saravanabhavan S   52:50
OK, so instead I didn't have, instead I can do a daily work on until the task missed.

Amanda Gilbert   52:50
But you have a workaround. Do what?
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   53:00
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   53:00
That's all that you can do until they fix the the part that's not working.

Saravanabhavan S   53:06
So before that I have to do a download or I'll just if I run this query to move to the end to the new, it's fine.

Amanda Gilbert   53:15
You have all. You don't have to do a download that's already scheduled.

Saravanabhavan S   53:19
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   53:19
You'll just have to run those queries to move them from new to active.

Saravanabhavan S   53:27
OK.
OK.

Amanda Gilbert   53:41
All right. Um.

Saravanabhavan S   53:45
And this one we took you, uh, create the dev task, right?

Amanda Gilbert   53:51

Saravanabhavan S   54:09

Thank you, guys. Hey, uh, Servon, are you uh?
Are you gonna be busy?
In about 30 minutes.

Saravanabhavan S   54:55
No jobs.
No jobs.

James Maki   54:58
OK, do you want to get on a call? I know Scar had asked us to spend a little bit of time, like some one-on-one time together. Can I? I'm gonna send a meeting out just for me and you for like an hour. Is that cool?

Saravanabhavan S   55:11
OK, James.

James Maki   55:12
OK. All right. I will see you then.

Saravanabhavan S   55:15
Thank you. Thanks.

Manjunath S   55:17
Yeah, James. So, James, so.

James Maki   55:17
Right.
Mhm.

Manjunath S   55:22
I have small doubt.
One second.
These two tickets I need to create and already they are dev talk. So for this report one right? Shall I link it to that? It is related to the reports like they're not getting the reports accurate number.

James Maki   55:47
Is this reports tab is not reporting accurate numbers?
For completed responses.
Alright, she didn't really tell us. Is she talking about The productivity reports?
'Cause I don't like that's.

Manjunath S   56:09
Like, yeah, completed response.

James Maki   56:13
OK, but like A. but.
But so like, is she talking about like The disputes submitted or or The pro? OK, all right, she is talking about The productivity reports. OK, all right. So I mean, we already kind of know about that being an issue. So there should, there should be A. problem ticket.

Manjunath S   56:22
The productivity report.
Mhm.

James Maki   56:35
Already. All right. And then and did you find?

Manjunath S   56:35
Yeah.

James Maki   56:40
Did you look in DevOps? You found The dev task board also.
Or that's what you're looking for now.

Manjunath S   56:44
Uh, productivity.
Productivity, I think it is not resolved yet still.

James Maki   56:51
Yeah, no, it's definitely not resolved for sure, 'cause that's gonna be something that Lyd's gonna have to work on. Yeah, incident.
Yeah, there should be something there. There we go. Yeah. So I think that's our main one there.

Manjunath S   57:08
Yeah, I will just update.

James Maki   57:09
If you would just ask her like can for like The like specific examples of like what she's seeing that's wrong just just so we have IT for The problem tickets.
And then I and then you could tell her that we're looking into it. Um.
Be able like in anything that these guys that these that The clients can show us like that shows us like The exact issue and anything that they that you guys can get from them to show that will be helpful.

Manjunath S   57:35
OK.
And I think this one also some I have some image issue.

James Maki   57:51
What was The did we did we complete that one? Oh, The history request 23229, The second one? Yeah, did we complete?

Manjunath S   58:00
This one, this one that's actually I need to send the report to their mail ID.

James Maki   58:08
OK, 'cause didn't we?

Manjunath S   58:11
Actually, we have sent them the report.

James Maki   58:13
OK. And then he was just having trouble accessing it, right?

Manjunath S   58:16
Yeah.

James Maki   58:20
All right. Oh, was it? Was IT Ben or Joey that was having trouble?

Manjunath S   58:25
Hmm.

James Maki   58:26
So I think it's just because whoever IT was, like they weren't copied. I think it's probably Joey, right? Yeah, Joey, can you open The attachment? He doesn't have access. OK, so I think if you just send The attachment again now, now that Joey has CC'd on it, send The attachment again.

Manjunath S   58:32
Yeah, doing, yeah.
Oh.
A.
OK.

James Maki   58:42
And then and then let's also send A. Zendesk password reset for Joey just to make sure that he can just make sure that he can log in and download The attachment.

Manjunath S   58:53
OK.

James Maki   58:53
And that should that should take care of it. Yeah, but I yeah, but so I think Joey just couldn't access IT because he wasn't originally on The ticket. So I think you just have to resend IT again now that he's on it.

Manjunath S   58:55
Shut us.
Uh.
Sure.

James Maki   59:05
All right.

Manjunath S   59:08
That a course.
Yeah, that's it. James dot. Yeah, James, if anything is there, this one James. Actually this is like this is ACDV report, right? I mean ACDV number.

James Maki   59:25
OK.
Yeah, IT looks like A. control number. Yeah. How documents are saved for us. Oh, this is for Columbia. Oh, this is for the.

Manjunath S   59:40
Yeah, yeah, this image issue.

James Maki   59:45
Yeah, alright, so this is for The renaming.

Manjunath S   59:49
Actually, they are facing the image.

James Maki   59:50
I got 35 images, but The download we received for images only contains The first image. What is going on here? OK.
Uh.
OK, so possibly what's happening is because we can receive up to five, up to five TIF files for A. single account. So I suspect that is probably The issue here.

Manjunath S   1:00:11
Mhm.
Yeah.

James Maki   1:00:23
Um uh.
Let's see, he gave us the control number. Look it up on the admin side real fast and let's look at the account history and let's go to the to the very, very beginning of the account history where the image was downloaded and it should tell us.
How many files there were O? Let's start there.
Yeah, but yeah, so these guys are requesting.
Or uh or are in the process of like requesting some uh.
Uh, renaming changes. Uh, but the problem is.
They've already changed their naming format with the credit bureaus, so now they're coming through inconsistently and so they're wanting us.

Manjunath S   1:01:19
Musti.

James Maki   1:01:21
Yeah, yeah, go to history. Alright.
So like whenever you're just looking at history stuff, it's certainly better to look it up on the admin side just so we're not actually going into the account, but it's fine. So let's go all the way down to the bottom. I'll I'll wait at the beginning.
OK.
All the way down.
There we go. OK, oh, and there is only one attachment. OK, alright, so there's only one file 'cause there's only one attachment. So alright, so I was wrong.
Uh, so that doesn't make sense for him to have only gotten the first image.

Manjunath S   1:02:00
Uh.

James Maki   1:02:05
Yeah, so that doesn't make sense at all. OK, this is on.
The API server.
Alright, uh, let's see if the file is. It should still be on the server. Let's let's go see.
But.

Manjunath S   1:02:33
Columbia.

James Maki   1:02:34
It should be on the API server. Let's go ahead, disconnect, disconnect from level one and let's go over to the API.

Manjunath S   1:02:53
Yes, I payable one.

James Maki   1:02:57
No, we want to go to API and I think it's gonna be API 02.
Uh, looks like you might have to go to my list.
Oh, I'll go to the. I mean, you can get it from. Actually, it might not be on here. Go to my the other one.
The the server list.
Uh, back. Uh, go up a level into documents.
Yeah, and the Azure server list.
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:04:53
This one Jim CPA photo.

James Maki   1:05:00
Yeah, that one. Yep.

Manjunath S   1:05:31
Same thing, the CD space on FTpedia.

James Maki   1:05:36
Well, you're on the API server, so there's no FTP directory.
Oh yeah, I mean, you can pretty much always bet it's always gonna start with slash sonnet, so you can pretty much always start there. And then if you aren't sure, just go there first and then do LL so you can see what's available.
No, you were right. You had it.

Manjunath S   1:06:01
OK, CDs is on it.

James Maki   1:06:04
Uh, you left out the space, but yeah.
Yeah, like you can. You can pretty much guarantee it's always gonna start here. So yeah, so do that first.
And then do LL so you can see the available subfolders. All right, so this is the API directory or server. So the only thing that this is used for is for the clients to pick up their images.
O Let's go into the images folder.
Alright, and now you now you should see your list of clients. So the the API structure, it it kind of mimics the image servers. So they're pretty much the same. Like if if you're going to one of these three servers, either the API or the two image servers, you're probably going to slash on it slash images first.
And then this is gonna be Genesis is is their name. They they have an alias. Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

Manjunath S   1:07:05
Genesis grid.

James Maki   1:07:15
All right, so since this is the API server, there's gonna be a lot of files here. See, I mean, you can list them out first if you want. That's fine. It doesn't matter, but we're gonna oh.
There's nothing.

Manjunath S   1:07:31
0.

James Maki   1:07:34
Alright, that's not what I expected. These guys are API, are they? Didn't I see? Don't they have a token? They do have a token.
I'm confused.

Manjunath S   1:07:52
Yeah.

James Maki   1:07:56
All right, so.

Manjunath S   1:07:56
API client teams.

James Maki   1:07:59
OK, but their image files aren't there.
Or.
Are these guys some kind of weird hybrid? What's going on here?
Uh.
OK, I guess, I guess so.
All right. Uh, OK, so I guess.
Yeah, that's not confusing at all.
Alright, so I guess these guys do the data transfer over API, but I guess their images are sent over FTP.
Alright, so that's kind of unique.
Experian.
All right, well, I guess you can get off of this server then. Apparently they don't use this for the images. All right, so that's actually that's unfortunate.
Um.
Alright, when was the when was the account received? Go back over to your sonnet.
Alright, uh uh, look it up again on the admin side.
Oh, how old is this dispute?
OK. Received on the 30th. OK, well, shoot.
Um.
Oh, well, OK, well.
Alright, alright, so if you go back, let's go go back over to the FTP server over to web 01. So it looks like.
It looks like they're moving.
All right, so they're moving all of their image files.
They're leaving them on our server.
Which is sort of good 'cause that means we can look at him, but.
Yeah, Genesis Grant again.
And go look in their process folder.
So they're leaving all their files out there.

Manjunath S   1:11:31
Uhuh.

James Maki   1:11:33
So for one, that's really annoying. We don't want them to do that. We I've said it before. We are not supposed to be infinite storage for these people. Like they're really kind of abusing us by doing this. But the good news is it looks like everything out there or everything should still be out there, so we can.
Look here and see if the file is there.
Alright, so do you have the do you have the control number copied?

Manjunath S   1:12:03
Yes, James.

James Maki   1:12:03
OK, alright, so let's do uh.
OK, all right, let's do a find Tye find and then sace star and then paste in the control number.
Take off the space at the end, hit hit hit backspace one time and then do another star.
All right, and hit enter.
OK. All right. So the file is there. So that's good. OK. All right. Let's see if we can. Let's see if you can download this. I think this will work. All right.
So uh, go over somewhere on your local on your local side. Uh, go to your folder.
Just anywhere really.

Manjunath S   1:13:01
New folder should create new one.

James Maki   1:13:03
No, like like on on your computer, go to like your local folders, like go go somewhere on your local machine.
And we and we need to open a git bash window.
Yeah, just go like to like to your downloads folder or something, something like that.

Manjunath S   1:13:45
Miss James.

James Maki   1:13:48
Alright, so right click on like a blank space and let's do a open git bash here.
And runs.
Run this command.
Uh, yes.
Alright, good. Alright. And then I'm gonna send you one more command.
Alright, and so we need to paste in the file name.
Uh.
So before you run that, go back to. Yeah, go back to the server. Copy the dot TIFF file name.

Manjunath S   1:15:08
Yeah.

James Maki   1:15:17
The dot TIF one, the dot TIF one, the one above that.

Manjunath S   1:15:17
The working.

James Maki   1:15:21
Yeah, yeah, copy the whole thing.
Alright, and then and then over in your bash window after after the processed slash.

Manjunath S   1:15:31
A.

James Maki   1:15:33
So go left one more space and then paste that. Paste that file name in right there. There you go. Alright, go ahead and run that.
Perfect. All right, so you have downloaded the file. All right, so if we go back to your Downloads folder, we should see that TIF image now.

Manjunath S   1:16:06
Yeah, it's a case.

James Maki   1:16:07
Alright, so let's let's take a look at that and let's see if we can see all the pages.

Manjunath S   1:16:15
Open with.

James Maki   1:16:15
The the the TIF file. The TIF file. You're clicking the wrong thing.
Yeah.
There we go. All right. And all right. And it looks like there's 38 pages there. So, So what's he talking about?

Manjunath S   1:16:28
Yeah.

James Maki   1:16:33
All right.
Alright, so we verified that all the pages are there. It's one file.
Dude, I've I've seen it before and I swear I bet he's probably just not looking at it right. And I bet he's just missing the page button where like wherever it is that he's looking, if he's looking at it in his system, whatever it is that he's doing.
But alright, but so we've verified now that all the pages are there, so you can so you can tell him.

Manjunath S   1:16:59
Uh-huh.
Uh.

James Maki   1:17:06
We have fair so you can tell them exactly what we did.
Uh.

Manjunath S   1:17:10
We have.

James Maki   1:17:15
Yeah, we we verified all pages are present in the file. I would send him the file name that you downloaded. I would send him that file name so you can tell him exactly what file to look at and you can also tell him it's still on the server. So if he wants to go redownload it, he can do that.
So most of the time people can't do this because I mean this, this is probably why we tell them to pick up their files, right? Is 'cause we don't we don't want, we don't want to be responsible for this kind of thing, but.

Manjunath S   1:17:52
Uh huh.

James Maki   1:17:59
But in this case, it is kind of good for us like that. We can literally tell him, yeah, just go download it again and see for yourself.
So that that is that is kind of helpful for us.
Available, yeah, on the server in I would say in the process folder and then I would say yeah and then.

Manjunath S   1:18:26
Available on the server in the.

James Maki   1:18:29
Yep, and yeah, in the process folder.
And so you're telling them exactly where to look.

Manjunath S   1:18:46
Oh, we'll attest the document that we have downloaded.

James Maki   1:18:51
Um.
I mean, I don't think you, I don't think you need to do that since it's already on the FTP and we saw as you were thumbing through those images, there is PII in there like it looked like there was a Social Security card. So I really would rather not send that.

Manjunath S   1:18:56
Yeah.
Uh huh.

James Maki   1:19:09
But uh yeah, but but give them the file name though. Like just just copy that and tell them this is the file.

Manjunath S   1:19:18
This is the file name right?

James Maki   1:19:19
Yeah, Yep, that one.

Manjunath S   1:19:35
Yeah.

James Maki   1:19:36
Yeah, yeah, I think that's good.
So I mean like this should have answered any questions that he has, right? Like like we verified that the images are all there. If you don't believe us, you can go download the file again. Here is where it is. Here's the file name.

Manjunath S   1:19:45
Ha ha.

James Maki   1:19:56
So yeah, so it should take should take care of it.

Manjunath S   1:19:57
OK.
Oh.

James Maki   1:20:00
All right, and so so save those commands that I just said because so like that's that's what you can use to download files off the FTP server. So you have to run that first command. So like that creates like the permission file, right? And I know we've talked about it before, but just to reiterate.

Manjunath S   1:20:04
Uhuh.

James Maki   1:20:15
So that was the that's what the first command I sent does is it sets up like your little the credential for you to log in. And then yeah, then that second one. So you're.
Like the the way that the commands work in there is just telling.
So that's like the that's the local IP address for the server is what that 10.104.4.50 is. So there's a different local IP address for each server, right? So like if you wanted to download from the API server, you could do that also. It's just gonna have a different IP address.

Manjunath S   1:20:45
Mhm.

James Maki   1:20:47
And I don't know all of them, but.
Uh, I think I do have the API one though.
I think it's buried in my history somewhere.
All right. Do you guys have have more tickets that you guys need help with? Do I need to set up some more time later on this afternoon?

Manjunath S   1:21:53
Uh, no.

James Maki   1:21:53
Well, my afternoon, I know it's already getting kinda late for you guys.

Manjunath S   1:21:59
Yeah, James, that something related to like asterisk symbol.
For the you just federal.
Like, uh, said like valid character. So again they were given a reply.

James Maki   1:22:27
To use Azure.
All right.
Alright, So what is she trying to do? She's trying to.

Manjunath S   1:22:46
First trying to like in the payment portal. Oh, she would like to use the asterisk symbol to remove this completely.

James Maki   1:23:06
Uh.
Um, I.
I think they just leave it blank, but I'm not positive.
Um.
Uh, yeah, that might be kind of a question for Amanda. Um.

Manjunath S   1:23:48
Yeah.

James Maki   1:23:48
Yeah, I don't. I don't think I have an answer on that one, unfortunately, or not, not one that I'm positive about anyway.

Manjunath S   1:23:54
Sure.
This mass good account. We have a OPS link for this items. Oh yeah, already Amanda has created, I think.

James Maki   1:24:13
OK, yeah, yeah. So I met just already got that in place, it looks like.

Manjunath S   1:24:28
Yeah, I just update this in on hold.
OK yeah James, so like how do we send the step to file for the previous date? Like I'll just check it but we haven't received the step two for the date 7/10.

James Maki   1:24:49
Alright, so the automation is only gonna pick up the current day's files, so if you're trying to get an old one, you have to do it manually.

Manjunath S   1:24:54
Mhm.

James Maki   1:24:59
Uh, so you have to go go get the credentials from VS code.
And from the server you have to log in and download the file.

Manjunath S   1:25:10
True code is for like ERC, right?

James Maki   1:25:17
True Accord is, yes, but was that was for team recovery, right?

Manjunath S   1:25:23
Oh yeah, so that thing recovery.
Oh, yes.
So password we have to remove the own special character items.

James Maki   1:25:58
Yes, yes, there is one there.

Manjunath S   1:26:03
On this one.

James Maki   1:26:05
Yep.

Manjunath S   1:26:12
We need this P no right only this is the password.

James Maki   1:26:18
Uh, that is the password. Yeah, the whole thing. Yep, you got it.

Manjunath S   1:26:28
Oh, we need to do so.

James Maki   1:26:31
You do so do control C to to stop the connection.
And then we'll we'll see if it'll let you connect now, 'cause these guys.
They do like a temporary logout every time you have a failed attempt.
OK, that's good.

Manjunath S   1:27:03
Oh.

James Maki   1:27:04
Alright, is that not the right password?
Open. Open up your terminal, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:27:11
This one.

James Maki   1:27:16
Yeah.
All right, all right. Just all right. I I don't like what you're doing. All right.
Did did the password get updated? Is there? Are are you behind? Open up your terminal. Do do control C again. Stop the connection.
All right, in VS code, open up your terminal.
Let's go to view, I think view terminal.
Alright, so let's do get checkout main.
Uh gets GIT.
No, whenever you're doing a get command in VS like in VS code, it's always gonna be GIT.

Manjunath S   1:28:14
OK, good check out main singles without space.

James Maki   1:28:20
Uh, with a space.
Space between out and main. Yeah, checkout's one word. Space. Space. Main. There you go. Yes.
Alright, and then do get pull.
Yep.
Now see in your team recovery commands just got updated.
All right, all right. OK, all right. So now you're up to date. closeout of your Team Recovery Step 2 tab.
Yeah, close it, don't save and then and then go back and open it again.
So it looks like you were using. You were using the old password because your script was not up to date.

Manjunath S   1:29:28
OK.

James Maki   1:29:29
So there's so there's the new password.

Manjunath S   1:29:46
No special characters, right? Yeah.

James Maki   1:29:49
Yeah, no, no escape character. Yep.
Mm.
All right, something.
OK.

Manjunath S   1:30:16
Mm.
I think it takes some time to grant the access right once it is denied.

James Maki   1:30:29
I mean possibly.

Manjunath S   1:30:32
Mhm.
OK Jim, so once we login into this, it will be in the out folder, right?

James Maki   1:30:42
Uh, yes.

Manjunath S   1:30:45
OK, so it will be in the database.

James Maki   1:30:46
I'm afraid. All right, I'm. I'm afraid that I really hope you didn't lock out our account.
Like that's actually.
Yes.
I don't understand what's happening. Why is this not working?
Why is that password not working?
Uh, yeah, it looks like that was taken care of.

Manjunath S   1:32:31
SCCS is so dungeon, so I just processed the step 2 files and all the dispute size been moved to the active status.

James Maki   1:32:40
Great.

Manjunath S   1:32:48
So just select those this ticket.

James Maki   1:32:54
Uh, yeah, it looks like it.

Manjunath S   1:33:21
Uh, Jim, so that uh landly the properties have been corrected.

James Maki   1:33:38
Oh yeah, what was?
Uh, was this one of the two that was that was having the?

Manjunath S   1:33:48
Yeah they were able to access so but some error they are getting in properly. So last time we checked it right.

James Maki   1:34:04
Yeah, alright. So I think we need to look at crush for this, right?

Manjunath S   1:34:08
Uh.

James Maki   1:34:10
Wait, what? What did that message say? What was that error?
OK.

Manjunath S   1:35:10
Properties.

James Maki   1:35:11
Yeah.
I.
Yeah, OK, so this is for Langley. All right, so this is connecting to the web 01 server is where this is looking. All right, so Langley FCU is the correct.
OK, alright, so in the in the URL go all the way to the end.

Manjunath S   1:35:40
Uh.

James Maki   1:35:47
And it should have Langley FCU there.

Manjunath S   1:35:50
Yeah.

James Maki   1:35:52
OK.
OK, uh, alright, hit. Uh, let's let's try and test it.
OK.
Right. Uh, was this the one that you? This was one that you had to remake, right? Because I had the 'cause I had the.org.

Manjunath S   1:37:07
Yes, James yeah.org I just but did it my mistake and.
We deleted all the directories for them and recreated once again.

James Maki   1:37:25
OK, all right. And so in here, did you just edit the URL? Did you take out the.org and then save it? Is that how you?

Manjunath S   1:37:34
Yeah, yeah, I removed the and updated it as a Lang FCU.

James Maki   1:37:36
OK.

Manjunath S   1:37:48
Yeah, before they were not able to access, but now they are able to access.

James Maki   1:37:48
OK.
Who was able to access?

Manjunath S   1:37:58
The line set of which.
Like Vikas has just got me an update like after creating the new one I just sent him like only team can access but there are error images they are getting.

James Maki   1:38:22
All right.
Alright, so the error messages are getting there, so it's having trouble listing the directory. So it seems like it's still having trouble finding the Langley FCU folder that you created. So that's so that's what's causing the error. So.
The way that I would try to address that.
Uh.
How should we address that?
All right. Um.
Let me see.
You guys still never had like Bitwardin access figured out, right?

Manjunath S   1:40:15
No, James.

James Maki   1:40:19
OK.
And I don't know what to do about that. Um.
So like what I wanna try and do is is copy.
The properties from another company like one that's working.
Is what I wanna try and do.
Um.

Manjunath S   1:41:09
Test.

James Maki   1:41:15
I mean, yeah, you can if you want.

Manjunath S   1:41:22
Yeah.

James Maki   1:41:23
Alright, so that's one that's working.
So I would start with copying the username.
The the problem is the password because the password is encrypted, so you can't just copy that. Copy the username.

Manjunath S   1:41:49
Oh.

James Maki   1:41:50
No, not that username. No, go, go back, go back to where you were.

Manjunath S   1:41:56
URL.

James Maki   1:41:57
Go go back to LFCU, go back to the other one.

Manjunath S   1:42:00
Yeah.
A.

James Maki   1:42:04
And and go to properties.
The username right there. It's like in the middle.
Or is it username and password?

Manjunath S   1:42:14
Yes. Oh.

James Maki   1:42:17
Yeah, that copy that.
Alright, and then and then cancel this and let's go back over to the Langley one.
Uh, go ahead and paste it over the username.
Alright, uh, and hit OK.
1.

Manjunath S   1:42:55
Save.

James Maki   1:42:58
Yeah, go ahead, save it and then let's test it and let's see if that did anything.

Manjunath S   1:43:05
Test.

James Maki   1:43:06
Yeah.
I feel like it's probably not gonna help, but who knows, yeah.
So connect cost.
Uh, what can we do here?
Uh, go back over to the end of the URL again.
OK.
Alright, alright, how do we how do we change this? Alright, so I think there's some stuff missing from the URL.

Manjunath S   1:46:12
Uh.

James Maki   1:46:14
Uh.
Alright, uh.
Here. Um.
OK, here.
Alright, uh, in the URL change.
Overwrite. What's there with this? So it looks like there might be some more stuff to the URL.
So like everything from like the at symbol over to the company name.
Yeah, so I'll put it in the chat so you so you can copy what I have and overwrite overwrite what's there.

Manjunath S   1:47:18
Still here?
This whole thing, James.

James Maki   1:47:24
Uh.
That that's what you're gonna overwrite, yes.
Except for the company name.
No, sorry, no, I I sent it. Copy what I sent.
Copy what I sent and overwrite what's there for the URL.

Manjunath S   1:48:19
From the Earth chamber.

James Maki   1:48:23
Right.
And then and leave the company, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:48:28
Yeah.

James Maki   1:48:35
No, I I already, I already sent it. I'm telling you what to paste in. I sent it. The thing that I sent. The last thing that I sent, I sent the URL, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:48:42
Are you saying? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

James Maki   1:48:50
Yeah.
There you go. Yeah, paste that in. Alright, and let's test that.
I don't know if we need to save it first. Let's see.

Manjunath S   1:49:15
Service shape or like?

James Maki   1:49:17
Alright, let's let's let's go and test it. I mean, why not? It's just a test.
Hey, there we go. Hell yeah, that's what I'm talking about. All right, it's OK.

Manjunath S   1:49:23
Yeah, that sounds sexy.

James Maki   1:49:30
Alright, uh, and then save.
Alright, and now.
Alright, and now let's have them try again. Alright, well, hold on, let's before we do that, let's see if I can.
Why don't we test it first? Do you do you have their FTP credentials?
I think you sent it to me.

Manjunath S   1:49:51
Yes, chips.
Yeah, I have it.

James Maki   1:49:56
All right, let me see if I still.

Manjunath S   1:49:56
And is available or not? Yeah, I will send you the password.

James Maki   1:50:03
Let me see if you already sent it. I think you did.

Manjunath S   1:50:07
I'll send you again, right?

James Maki   1:50:18
All right, and this is for Langley FCU.
Wow, what the heck?
Alright, it's still saying it's having trouble listing the.
Yeah, come on, man. Really.
Alright, go back over to crush, see if it. Is it giving the error again?

Manjunath S   1:51:35
So we test the connection again.

James Maki   1:51:38
Yeah, did did you save it?

Manjunath S   1:51:42
Yeah.

James Maki   1:51:45
The.
Uh, check the URL again.
Yeah, it's back. It doesn't have the the dot file dot core. It doesn't have that stuff again.
Where's that pulling from?
Uh, try updating the URL again. Uh.
Paste in the the part that I sent.
What the heck?
All right, hit OK.
All right, and save again.
All right, let's go back to properties.
And and check to check the URLs, see if it's still there.
OK, alright.

Manjunath S   1:53:08
Test.

James Maki   1:53:12
Uh, no. I'm just gonna go ahead and run.
What the heck?
Why is this Kee reverting?
What is going on here?
That is not correct. You're not.
Go and test it.
OK.
So why am I still not getting into VaZilla?

Manjunath S   1:55:00
So I check the URL once again.

James Maki   1:55:05
Uh, sure.

Manjunath S   1:55:18
Wishing that file code.

James Maki   1:55:21
And it was gone again, wasn't it?

Manjunath S   1:55:23
Yeah.

James Maki   1:55:28
What the heck?

Manjunath S   1:55:43
OK.

James Maki   1:56:10
It wasn't. There was a second person that was having trouble, wasn't there? Wasn't there another client that was having like the same issue or something similar?

Manjunath S   1:56:21
No, James, only for Langley, I think so.

James Maki   1:56:25
Yes.

Manjunath S   1:56:30
But for the SFTP Selana had on ticket, I don't know what was the update on the Selana.

Saravanabhavan S   1:56:42
Yes, man, Joe.

Manjunath S   1:56:44
Yeah, I don't ticket it for that SFTP creation. Is it done?
Are you facing any issues on the?

Saravanabhavan S   1:56:55
So the only thing is build bottom access we raise the ticket.

Manjunath S   1:57:01
For the IP address.

Saravanabhavan S   1:57:05
No IP address. I done that. The teammate ticket you're asking, right?

Manjunath S   1:57:08
Oh, OK.
No, no, for the SFTP only. Oh yeah, don't take it right for the new connection SFTP.
Hello.

Saravanabhavan S   1:57:37
Yes, blue checking, blue it 812.

Manjunath S   1:57:48
So I think only for the the slam.
Mhm.

Saravanabhavan S   1:57:57
SFTPI don't have manjo but IP has been widely trans.

Manjunath S   1:58:05
OK.
Oh.
Um.

James Maki   1:58:11
Uh.
All right, I'm showing that the test is still successful when I when I try it.
Um, but when I try in FileZilla, like it's saying it's connected, but it's not actually listing out.
Like the contents like I can't see the image images and process folders.
So it's definitely not working.

Manjunath S   1:58:41
Uh, have you checked in the server?

James Maki   1:58:42
Please.
I mean, I don't think there's really anything to do on the server.
I think it has to do with like with the way that the the login is trying to find the directory. Like that's where the problem seems to be.
But.
All right. Um.
Let's try right over in crush. Let's just try setting up a whole new destination for it. Go ahead and cancel this. Or actually, let's see what? Yeah, go ahead. Dang it. How are we gonna do this?
Alright, I think I'm gonna have to do it since.
I'm the only one that's in.
Alright.
All right.
I'm just gonna create a new one, new remote item.
SMB 3.
FCU.
Alright, why didn't?
Oh, I think I supposed to do that first, OK.
OK.
Yes.
So here.
Spell stuff right.
Yeah, come on. Are you kidding me? What the hell is your deal?
Oh, why is this not saving currently? Why does this keep changing? I don't understand.
Why? Why do you keep ******* changing?
Literally doesn't make any sense.
This is so ******* annoying.
I don't understand why I just keep changing. Why is it not saving?
Just crap.
Just a bunch of crap.
It just immediately overrides it. It just immediately takes it out. It's not doing anything right. Now you don't even have to ******* add symbol here. What the hell?
This thing is so stupid.
Finally got it.
Oh my God, that was an absolute pain.
Bro, how are you gonna start giving an error after you just ******* worked? How the hell?
Unbelievable.
All right, I don't know what's going on. It keeps reverting like it's not saving the change, like the thing with the URL. That's definitely the problem.
I don't know why. I don't know why it's broken. I don't know.

Manjunath S   2:09:39
OK.

James Maki   2:09:45
I don't know, I don't know. But that's the answer. It's like it's the URL.
Because whenever it's there, whenever it has it the way that I set it, when I tell it what to ******* use, it works and then it keeps removing it and it keeps going back.
To the old URL and every time it does that is when it stops working.
So I don't know what's going on.
Um.
But that is 100% the problem.

Manjunath S   2:10:20
Oh.
Sados.
So like there'll be regularly, there'll be accessing like all the other items. So is this a major issue?

James Maki   2:10:35
And now it's and now it's working again.
All right, now it's working.

Manjunath S   2:10:48
OK.

James Maki   2:10:49
Alright, so maybe if we just stop touching it.
All right, it should be working now.
Lang Langley should be working.

Manjunath S   2:11:07
Yeah.
So like we need to test it again or just shall I respond to the OK, OK, OK.

James Maki   2:11:13
No, don't touch. Do not. Do not test it again. Don't touch it. It's working. Just respond on the ticket and tell them. Tell them to try it again.
Alright, alright, I need to drop so I have another call coming up.

Manjunath S   2:12:27
Oh.
Sure, yes.

James Maki   2:12:28
And and I have my own tickets that I'm working on. I'm trying to finish up today.

Manjunath S   2:12:33
Yeah.

James Maki   2:12:35
Alright, so let me do this. If there's anything else like high priority you guys still want help with today, shoot me a message and I should be done.
In 45 minutes. And if there's something else that I need that I can help you guys with, I will do what I can.

Manjunath S   2:12:48
Yeah.
OK, James.

James Maki   2:12:53
All right. All right. Thank you, guys.

Manjunath S   2:12:54
Thank you, James.

Saravanabhavan S   2:12:58
My minutes.

James Maki   2:12:59
Alright, alright, no problem. Talk to you later.

Manjunath S started transcription

James Maki   0:05
What's the issue?
But Amanda wasn't really understanding. Amanda's not even CC'd on this like she followed up on the ticket, but she's not even.
Like a follower on here, so so she's not gonna see.
Did uh, did you just add her as a follower?
Or was she already there?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:38
On James.

James Maki   0:38
Did did you add Amanda as a follower or was she already there? You did. OK, OK, OK, good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:41
Yes. No, no, I have it now.

James Maki   0:55
All right.
Um.
OK, I don't. I don't know if we need Amanda for this to set up a call.
Mm.
OK, you've added a band to. All right, let's ask.
Ask what times they're available tomorrow for a call.
And and you haven't met a copied on it, so she'll be aware. I think we can handle this without her because if they just need us to to regenerate some receipts like we can, we can do that.
Yeah, yeah. So just ask what times they're available tomorrow and we'll and we'll try and set something up.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:55
OK.

James Maki   1:55
I put a put a put a Amanda, put Amanda back on there. Like I do want her to be a follower. I'm just saying I don't know if we I don't think. I don't think we'll actually need her on the call, but I do want her to be aware of it though.
Yeah, So what time's tomorrow you're available?
And then we'll we'll figure out how we want to schedule it out.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:39
OK.

James Maki   2:44
Tomorrow. What time's? What time's tomorrow?
Because we don't.
I do not have time this afternoon, so I don't want them to.
Be like, let's get on a call in an hour. Like, no, sorry, we can't do that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   3:29
Newbase transformed little matter files for fair options.

James Maki   3:33
All right, so that is one that I'm working on with Liddy. I sent he needed the list of control numbers. I sent that to him earlier today.
So hopefully either either today or tomorrow, hopefully we can get that wrapped up and closed. But yeah, so I did make progress on that here if you want to put the the dev link for that.
Here, I'll I'll drop it in the chat for you.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   4:05
Yeah.

James Maki   4:08
And then and then you can put that on hold for right now.
So I because I think they actually have a duplicate ticket.
Yeah, that's OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   4:49
OK, so for retail also he needs.

James Maki   4:53
Yes.
Alright, so remember you're you're in the production environment.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:23
Which environment this is Dev environment?

James Maki   5:27
So in the in the title in CQA.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:32
So.
Thank you, OK.

James Maki   5:36
Yeah, yeah, I have. I have no idea what a certain environment is. I don't know where he got that from, but.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:43
But before for mortgage we have given in the production only, right?

James Maki   5:49
No, we gave them. They they had the one for production. We sent them the one from from CQA. So if you remember like they were using the wrong token. So we sent them the right one for mortgage. I don't think they have. I don't think retail is set up in.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:56
OK.

James Maki   6:10
Is it NCQA? I think everything previously was just from orchids.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:16
Yes, it's not there.
No, we do have.

James Maki   6:24
OK.
OK.
Yeah, you can, uh, go ahead and send them that. Yep.
Alright, it's there. Cool.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:41
Mm.

James Maki   7:03
Yeah, you're good. OK.
Cool.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:34
shall I put it in pend it

James Maki   7:39
No, I think you can go ahead and close it again because yeah, because he he said he's going to open up a new, a new ticket whenever they get the disputes from you, Oscar, right. So I think you're still, yeah, so you're still good to close up.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:50
Yes.
Hey.
OK.
Oh.

James Maki   8:07
Excuse me.
Is that all of them?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:10
It.
Yes.

James Maki   8:12
Wait.
All right. How about you, Margio?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:17
That's.

Manjunath S   8:22
Nya James. Definitely I have it.
This one I have to just update it on hold or?

James Maki   8:44
Oh, OK, not sure.

Manjunath S   8:46
Hello.

James Maki   8:52
Yeah, this was one. This was one that I wanted to.

Manjunath S   8:53
This is from.

James Maki   8:58
I want to try to clarify with Amanda, right? Um.
So because I think they're about to be changing their account numbers anyway.
This was one I want to talk about this. I wanted to do this on a Level 3 call, didn't I? This was one from.
Last Thursday we were looking at.
Um.
Uh, all right. Uh, can we?
Should we just ping Amanda about this and see if we can get an answer?
Right. Uh.
Trying to remember how we did this.
Uh, did the.
To download anything for them, no.
This is for Genesis.
Did I just look at their files?
Yeah, all right. Yeah, these guys are apparently moving.
Every image file they pick up, apparently they're moving them to.
Rocess folder.
And not removing them from our.
List too long.
What?
There we go.
That didn't move anyway.
Oh my God.
Clients.
What I'm trying to do is I'm I'm trying to get to one of their. Oh, these guys are API, aren't they? I think I'm.
Wait, no, they're not. No, they're not there because I'm in their folder.

Manjunath S   15:08
OK.

James Maki   15:13
Yeah, they are API.
That's right. OK. And that was why we couldn't figure out more because there was no file for us to go look at. It was just coming from the API, so.
Um.
M.
Is there an API log that we can look at that will tell us?
Is there anything that tells me what client this is for?
Alright, so I'm on the API server now.
And I'm looking for a log that's going to.
Potentially help us.
Yes.
Yeah.
So confused. What am I looking at here?
OK, that's on RPAO too. OK, that's fine. OK.
I don't have any answer on this right now on the.
Uh, Columbia.
Um.
I mean, I don't know if.
Yeah, like when my last note on there still is still.
Kind of where I'm stuck at. I don't.
I'm not finding uh the company in.
The API logs. I mean, I might just not be looking in the right place, so I'm not sure.
Yeah, we need help. We need help researching that one because I'm just not sure where to look.
Yeah. And so I I do not have an update on that right now.

Manjunath S   25:36
OK, Jim, so any update on this thing?
Oh, just.

James Maki   25:59
Well, there's a dev task on there.
So where's? Where's? So where's that at? It's on hold. Why is it on hold?

Manjunath S   26:03
Yeah, it's on hold.
So we given any response and we ask for estimated.

James Maki   26:15
What's going on with the dev task?

Manjunath S   26:20
Object I think so.

James Maki   26:26
All right, let's let's go look at the dev task because it's been, it's already been escalated to the dev team. So if they want an update, then we need to know where the dev team is at. What have they done?
If anything.
Oh, that was this one. OK. All right. So we were just talking about that earlier this morning, right? That was the one that then I was asking about.
So I can't remember what did Vinay say he was working on that today.

Manjunath S   27:54
So.

James Maki   27:58
Or was that a different one?

Manjunath S   28:14
So the develop team is working on this right?

James Maki   28:21
Yes, yeah, yeah, 'cause Vinay was asking about that on the on the stand up call today.

Manjunath S   28:31
So I get the same response.

James Maki   28:34
I guess.

Manjunath S   29:04
Yeah.
Well, this one, Jim. So actually they've got settled like QA. We asked for. We search for the username, but we didn't find right? So again, they'll send the username.
I tried to search.

James Maki   29:26
Oh, it's their user, Anna. OK.

Manjunath S   29:29
Yeah.

James Maki   29:38
All right, well, all right. Well, for one, you just try to search by Anna, which is the first name, and you put that in the last name field. But for two, this is an employee, not a consumer. So you can't search that way because that's looking for consumers. That's looking for people like.

Manjunath S   29:47
Uh.

James Maki   29:56
With disputes, but they're talking about a user like a person who's working the disputes, not not someone who has a dispute, so.

Manjunath S   30:02
Can.

James Maki   30:08
Alright, well, what's what's the ticket number?

Manjunath S   30:15
It's 22850.

James Maki   30:21
Update disputes changes. Changes are not staying. Please refer to Anna disputes in QA that were sent 75% setting.
Employee made the proper changes, but they did not save.
OK.
OK, I understand, but they still did not give us a dispute ID for us to look at.
What? What do they expect us to do?

Manjunath S   30:55
That's it.

James Maki   30:56
And I do not see anything in the QAQ from Anna.
Anna hasn't worked since June 13th was the last time that she was in Sonnet.
All right, she like she needs to give us an actual ID to look at, especially if the user hasn't been in there for a freaking week.
Like what?
Like if they want us to look at the history of anything, they have to tell us what dispute to look at, right? Like we can't.

Manjunath S   31:50
But where do we find this?
The user.

James Maki   31:57
Yes, it is a user. It is someone who is working inside Sonnet. So it is one of the United Auto employees.

Manjunath S   32:03
OK.
Mhm.

James Maki   32:16
Alright, but so she's saying that like changes did not stay like.
This is so annoying.
Right, that changes there.
May 2025 change blank to L.
2025 change blank to L.
Terms duration 12001 change from 74 to 0.

Manjunath S   33:28
The.

James Maki   33:45
All right, so I just went through just a. I just chose the first dispute in their QA queue just to see what I could find.
So let's go ahead and do that. Alright. So yeah, so I just went, yeah, so I just went into that first one because I I don't see Anna's name on any of these, but I just went in just to see what I could find. So yeah, let's go into that and so let's go down to the history.

Manjunath S   33:56
This one.

James Maki   34:10
So, so she's saying that the changes that the user is making are not being saved.
So we have to look at the history to see what it is that she changed. All right, so she's in here. So there's a few things that she changed. So we can see she changed like actual payment amount, changed that from 74 to zero. She changed the terms duration from one to 001. She made, I mean changed the payment history.

Manjunath S   34:34
Mhm.

James Maki   34:37
She changed May 2025 from blank to L So let's go to the account tab and let's see if we can see those changes.
And the information.
Mm.
All right, so terms frequency or terms duration is one that she changed and we can see 001. It's a right below the fixed. All right, so that we saw that in the history that's still there. So that's saved.
We see in the actual payment amount they have a 0.
It's down a couple more, so right right above the last highlight.

Manjunath S   35:26
This one, yeah.

James Maki   35:27
Yeah, right above it. Yeah. So she changed it from 74 to zero. We see the zero. So that was saved. She also changed the payment history. So if you Scroll down just a little bit in May 2025, we should see an L and we do. So that was saved.
So all the changes that Anna made were saved because they're still here. So let's respond. Go ahead, copy the sonnet ID from the URL.
Yeah, go ahead, copy that and and let's tell her we reviewed this dispute.
That is it.
Uh, where Anna made changes?
And we see the changes still on the dispute.
Or are still saved on the dispute. Yeah, let's say saved.
Uh.
So is yeah, alright, so you can do a do a full stop there and let's just ask like is there another? Is there a dispute where the changes are not saved?
Like we we need her to give her to give us a dispute that we can actually review and see where that is not being saved, right? So we review, we reviewed one, we verified that the changes were saved. So now we need an example of where the issue is actually occurring because so far we have not seen it.

Manjunath S   37:06
Oh.

James Maki   37:16
I know we only checked one dispute, but.
That's all the time that they're getting out of us if they can't tell us where to look, so.

Manjunath S   37:32
Pending.

James Maki   37:33
Yeah, yeah, split it in pending. Let's see if she can give us an example and and don't forget to exit the disputants on it. Make sure you return to queue to get out of it.
Yeah, right. That way we don't don't keep it locked on them.

Manjunath S   37:58
This one, James, actually we have closed this ticket. The follow up ticket is 22651. Actually it is sold. What today Sagar has just opened that it's still machine from May 28, 29th, 3031st.
And there's a lot of student.

James Maki   38:29
Well, where's he getting that from?
Why is he saying that?
Oh.
Are you ******* kidding me? You gotta be ******* kidding me with this, dude.

Manjunath S   39:25
Just.
Just a minute, Chips.

Saravanabhavan S   39:44
It seems like I have to get.
22918 and 2294 regarding uh productivity report.

James Maki   40:23
Hi.
Yeah, we we we know, we we know that productivity reports are broken. We have a dev task for it.
That's nothing.
That's that's nothing that we're gonna be able. That's nothing we're gonna be able to fix.

Saravanabhavan S   40:42
Yeah, so what should I give a reply like this is I just give the reply that this issue has been escalated to dev team, so that's fine.

James Maki   40:50
Yeah, yeah, that's basically all you can say because we don't have, we don't have any kind of timeline like it's it's gonna be a big fix because like you're talking about refactoring and building. Yeah, and I think.

Saravanabhavan S   40:59
OK.

James Maki   41:04
And priority wise, I think reporting is kind of is kind of a notch below everything else that they have going on. Yeah. So I think that's the best you can say for right now.

Saravanabhavan S   41:07
OK.
And at 22870 James we sure or like the the the issue also has to be escalated to.
22870.

James Maki   41:28
A task needs to be for this. What is this? Read for them to review again? I have attached the logic. OK, so that's that's a rules request.
So I mean, we can look at the Word document and just make sure that it's in.
A good readable formatting and yes it is.
Um.
Yeah, so yeah, all all all rules requests have to go to the dev team, so we have to make a task for that.

Saravanabhavan S   42:02
Oh.
So I just give a repay to them that the devotee map we ask later to devotee.
It's fine.

James Maki   42:18
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   42:20
On 22792 James.

James Maki   42:34
Uh, that is also a productivity report, right? Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   42:39
But.
Shall I link the ticket to the productivity report? So because I didn't link to that.

James Maki   42:48
Uh, the one that you just said are.

Manjunath S   42:49
Yes, there is a problem.

Saravanabhavan S   42:51
Yeah.

James Maki   42:52
The the one you, yeah, the one you just said, that one already was linked.
But what was again 227?

Saravanabhavan S   42:58
You do.
That is the link.

James Maki   43:01
So 1/2.

Manjunath S   43:03
Oh.

Saravanabhavan S   43:05
22792.

James Maki   43:06
92.

Saravanabhavan S   43:09
That is not just wait a minute. Let me check. Yes, that was link. Thank you. OK, that's that's from my side.

James Maki   43:15
Yep.
OK.

Manjunath S   43:32
This is from source, right? Jones?

James Maki   43:35
All right.

Manjunath S   43:38
Uh.

James Maki   43:44
Yes, this is from source and they said a bunch of ******** is what they said.
All right, so they said they didn't.
All right. So on 6/1, there was an issue, right? That was when we were coming off at the weekend and on that Monday.
Something was going on. Was that the Monday that downloads were stopped?
Something was going on that day.

Manjunath S   44:25
Yeah.

James Maki   44:26
So the receipts from June 1st were generated on June 2nd instead.
So they are out there, they just have the wrong date on them.
So that's true for the receipts.
If we check.
May 28th. All right, so next thing I'm gonna say. All right, so this is part of the problem right here. Well, actually, and actually, it's not even a problem. This is gonna be great. No, hold on. You're gonna love this. Go over to the server. Go over to web 01.

Manjunath S   45:09
Yeah, I think I'm already on the border.

James Maki   45:12
Yeah.
Well, you're you're on RPO too. Yeah, go to web 01.
You're you're on the image server. Go to the FTP.
You're going to love this.
It's taking its time.
Yeah, just go to sources though.
Yeah, those are images. Yeah, good images.

Manjunath S   46:39
Images.
Resets.

James Maki   46:44
And going. No, don't not receipts. Go to go to the equity.
The Equifax one, the one, the one at the top, yeah.
Yeah, going there. Alright, now do instead of LL.
Do a instead do LS space dash LTR.
Your screen just froze.
There we go. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

Manjunath S   47:31
Enter.

James Maki   47:32
Yeah, yeah, do enter. So, so this will put it in order.
Like in order by date, so this way we can see all the files for any given day.
So for one, so for one if you notice while that was loading.

Manjunath S   47:48
May 28, 2013.

James Maki   47:54
Their files go like all the way back. They go like to December, like their stuff from last year. They're not picked, like they're not removing the files. So that's one problem, but that's not what we're focused on right now. So she said that they're missing the files from the end of May, right? That's what she said.

Manjunath S   48:10
OK.

James Maki   48:12
Yeah, So what? What dates exactly did she say?

Manjunath S   48:17
May 28, 2930 31st.

James Maki   48:20
Uh-huh. Yeah. OK, so on the server. So we are, yeah, so we already see.
On the server, right, right there we are. We already see May 31st, we see May 30th, 29th, they're all there. So that's ********. The the first is potentially the only ones that are missing, but I believe those ones from the second, I believe.

Manjunath S   48:28
31st OK.
OK.

James Maki   48:45
Those will include the ones from the first because again, like the downloads were stopped. So then whenever it resumed, they would have all been received. So I mean we can, well, I mean even like trying to look these up, I'm sure everything is just going to say received on June 2nd.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's no files from June 1st because of the download issue. So everything from that day was sent on the 2nd.
And the image files from the ending from the last days of March or May, all of those are still on the server. So if she wants them, she can just download them. They're already there. You don't have to do anything.

Manjunath S   49:32
7.

James Maki   49:33
But also they need to be removing their files like we are not infinite storage for our clients like it is an issue when they do this.

Manjunath S   49:33
OK.

James Maki   49:43
Because this takes up server space, right? Like this. And when we have multiple clients, especially our bigger ones, people like Credence who aren't removing their files, like that's going to create issues for us. So they need to do their job.

Manjunath S   49:51
OK.

James Maki   49:58
And do their part.
But so, so on the ticket we can say we've verified all.
Oh, oh, never mind. Hold on. Wait, he did say receipts. Why was I thinking images?
Oh, all bureaus on June 1st, OK.
All right. I was getting confused. All right, hold on. All right, let's go back to the receipts.
And let's see.
Maybe I got a little bit ahead of myself.
All right, so receipts from May 28th are on there.
So it would have been.
Yeah, so receipts from that weekend.
Oh God, that's not even the weekend because it stops on the 28th, which was a Wednesday. So receipts for Thursday, Friday. I think I messaged Lee about this. Did I did I stumble across this and then asked him to check?

Manjunath S   51:06
So.

James Maki   51:07
Think fixed it.
I can't remember now. This is 3 weeks ago.
Oh, regardless, my answer, my answer hasn't changed.
All right, we just have to reword it a little bit.
All right, so.
Just confirm that we did not receive.
Any disputes on June 1st, right?
No. OK.
OK, so the image files for June 1st.
Oh.
Would have been downloaded on June 2nd.
So those files are available on the server. This is your answer no.
Are you ready? Yeah. So this this is our response. This this is our answer.

Manjunath S   52:32
Should I go back?

James Maki   52:41
Images on June 1st were downloaded on June 2nd.
And are available on the server.
Yeah, full stop there. And then the receipts for those days, if you just wanna copy them, probably be easier, were also generated on June 2nd.
It are available on the server.
But they are all labeled as June 2nd because that's when they were generated.

Manjunath S   53:37
1.
I get to run into a public repays, OK, Raja.

James Maki   53:50
Uh, yes, yeah, public reply.
And then I would also mention, because if we don't mention it, then it's never gonna get like nothing's ever gonna be done about it. We should also mention that we notice.
Uh.
We noticed all the historic image and receipt files are still on the server.
Please ensure those have been downloaded.
And then they need to be removed from the server.
So that we know they've been picked up.

Manjunath S   54:52
Something about.

James Maki   54:55
Yeah. Oh, well, it's it's just so so that we can tell that they've been picked up, because if they leave them out there, then we don't know if they picked them up, right? Yeah. So just so that we can tell they've been picked up.
Because otherwise it's on us to just remove them.
And.
But.
Yeah. And so potentially if they, yeah, it just is what it is, whatever. Yeah, that that's, that's good.
Yeah, I would say, man, that's not even a task. Like, we didn't do anything. That's just a question. Like, yeah, I mean, like, you can do a task if you want. It doesn't really matter. But I'm just like, man, whatever, it doesn't matter, whatever.

Manjunath S   55:47
OK.
We haven't ops to thing for two, so on hold open.

James Maki   55:53
Check. Yeah, let's check the let's check the dev tasks, see what that is, because I don't think we need anything from them. So if there's a test, a dev task for this, then I mean we can potentially just close it.
I think 8216 is the it is close. OK, good. Yeah, that's what I thought.

Manjunath S   56:14
It's closed.

James Maki   56:22
Yeah, yeah, because Liddy, because when I found that receipts hadn't been running, Liddy fixed it. And that's what that task was, I think.

Manjunath S   56:31
Sorry.

James Maki   56:34
Uh.
Let's do pending right now, just so just in case they have like a just in case they have some kind of response.
Just because I don't want another follow up ticket if we close it.
So this was something that I know Lydia was working on. I don't as Andrea hasn't mentioned it again. I believe it got fixed. If you want to verify with her, just ask.
If Liddy completed this.
Because I I know he was the one that was working on it.
So let's just ask if this is still an issue.
And and if it is, then we'll have to.
I think it was already a temp task, so might have to like reopen it or something, I don't know.

Manjunath S   57:42
Is the series completed of to independent status?

James Maki   57:54
Yeah, I think that's good. Then let's let's see what she says.
I know there's already so many things that they're trying to escalate, but this is like an old one that should have been.
Or was done.

Manjunath S   58:10
So public supply only or you talking about?

James Maki   58:10
Yeah.
Uh, public. Yeah, I'll do public.

Manjunath S   58:15
The name.

James Maki   58:17
Yeah, let's do pending. Yeah, 'cause we need her to confirm.

Manjunath S   58:35
This one thing so.
This is what result for the.

James Maki   58:43
Uh.
Oh, so, yeah, so we talked about this.
On the Sprint call yesterday I I gave them like a little demo of where it was happening.
Um.
Do we do we have a dev task on there?
I think we do.

Manjunath S   59:09
No.

James Maki   59:11
OK, I know, I know we created one.
Except for.
OK, so there is a ticket from opportunity.
That had the same issue, right?
But of course I do not have the ticket number on here.
This one. All right. And is this a problem? It is not. It is now.
This is for.
All right, 22773, all right. And you are on.
You are on ticket 22714.
OK, you can make that an incident.

Manjunath S   1:01:12
Oh.

James Maki   1:01:13
And I just turned another ticket into a problem for this.
Oh, wait, hold on. Did I make? Hold on. I didn't misread this, did I?
This is like the 80s.
Yeah, not appearing on the streets, OK.
OK, yeah, incident. And then it should be the first problem that you see there 'cause it should be the newest one.

Manjunath S   1:02:01
OK.

James Maki   1:02:03
For for link problem, yeah, yeah, the opportunity one.

Manjunath S   1:02:08
Yeah.

James Maki   1:02:08
Yeah, and then change the change the category. It's not. It's not AUD. This is.
We don't have like a UI issue, do we? Or like a UI option? I should probably add that. I think we're kind of at the point we need it. Let's just do dispute management I guess.
Yeah, and then let's also change the subject on this. Change that from AUDQ.
Change that to AUD not showing in 360 view.
Yes. So that's that's actually like an accurate description of what's happening. It has nothing to do with the AEDQ. OK, and go ahead and oh, and I'll send you the link.
It's coming.
Here is the link link. Yeah, here's the link for you.

Manjunath S   1:03:35
Yeah.

James Maki   1:03:42
Oh yeah, put it on hold. Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:03:58
Onward.

James Maki   1:04:06
Uh, yes, on hold.

Manjunath S   1:04:10
No.
Yeah.

James Maki   1:04:15
Yeah, it's kind of lagging a little bit.

Manjunath S   1:04:22
Yeah, my network is.
OK.

James Maki   1:04:28
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:04:30
So.
There's a problem ticket.

James Maki   1:04:39
Yes.

Manjunath S   1:04:43
This is the problem. This on the on my end just to have this one. We are waiting for customer response, yeah.
Uh.

James Maki   1:05:12
All right. Well, uh, so we, uh.
I mean, should we take a break here?

Manjunath S   1:05:20
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   1:05:22
I like for 22870 can you share me the dev link?

James Maki   1:05:22
It does, yes.

Saravanabhavan S   1:05:31
Because he told me like we have to create a task for the ticket for the team.

James Maki   1:05:32
2.
Uh, you have to make it. You have you have to make the link.
So like use it, you know, use like the apps on the right hand side.
You use the apt to.

Saravanabhavan S   1:05:47
I just just waiting. Actually I don't have access, I think so. Just waiting.

Manjunath S   1:05:54
It is effective to draw DPS on transaction of intent.

James Maki   1:05:59
Yeah, so if you click the the four squares on the far right.
Or not the four, the nine squares. Yeah, so I see you wanna make. Yeah, so you wanna make a user story is what you wanna make.

Manjunath S   1:06:06
Yeah.
And.

Saravanabhavan S   1:06:14
So like we can view task as user story.

James Maki   1:06:20
Yes, yeah, yeah. Like that is that that is the task.
Yeah, so no. So do a do user story because a task goes under like a task gets assigned to either a user story or a bug.

Saravanabhavan S   1:06:35
OK, so shall I give you a story?

James Maki   1:06:36
So like a yeah, yeah, so do a user story and yeah, and it's gonna be just mid Florida rules logic or no touch logic. Make sure you put the the ticket number. Add that to the title here.

Saravanabhavan S   1:06:52
OK.

James Maki   1:06:56
And then and make sure you check the box on the attachments 'cause that's gonna be like the actual, yeah, like that's the actual like rules request.

Saravanabhavan S   1:07:14
So which iteration I have to give?

James Maki   1:07:16
Let's put it. Let's put it in the next one. Yeah, let's put it in 99 since since this Sprint is already pretty full. Yeah, so that's good.
Yeah, uh, in the descriptions.
Um.
Yeah, I'll see you can just take all that out, yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   1:07:58
It's fine now.

James Maki   1:08:00
Uh.
Yeah, yeah, it's it's said in the message that the rules is attached, right? Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   1:08:14
So what should I give to the for the acceptance criteria?

James Maki   1:08:19
I mean this is a rules request, so I would just say the no touch rules deployed like yeah, cause like this this it's not done until it's deployed. So that's really.
Yeah, it's really like the only acceptance criteria is.
Put it in place and deploy. Yeah, I'd say no touch logic is deployed. Yeah, it's not something like that.

Saravanabhavan S   1:08:49
So uh, just no touch.
Roads fine, right?

James Maki   1:08:54
Uh yeah, is is deployed.

Saravanabhavan S   1:08:58
OK.

James Maki   1:09:01
Yeah, I think that's good. Yeah. So you go in and create the story. Oh, we need to put the put the priorities and stuff.
Oh, also in in area, yeah, I'll do threes for the severity and the priority. I'll just do threes for that.

Saravanabhavan S   1:09:23
On priority.

James Maki   1:09:24
Uh, yeah, 3.
Yeah, yeah, well, we're just gonna do 3, so it's kind of by default in the area. Select a select support.
The area drop down is right above iterations.
Yeah, there's another drop down right above that.

Saravanabhavan S   1:09:47
It's not working.

James Maki   1:09:48
There's another drop down called area.
Right above the iterations.
Look to the next field.
Go U to the next field.
Go up to the next field. There you go. Support. There you go. That's what I was looking for. All right, now you can create the story.
Yeah, N 99. Yep.

Saravanabhavan S   1:10:15
Actually they they it is also discredited in this song.

James Maki   1:10:18
Yeah, yeah, that's that's good because because the instructions are attached. So I mean like that's where the real request is, right? Is they they just need to know to check the attachments.

Saravanabhavan S   1:10:30
It's telling a user story now.

James Maki   1:10:31
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
All right, well, so you you actually you could have gotten to it from there. So you need to go over to Azure.
We're gonna have to go, yeah, go start, like open up a new tab and go over to Azure. We're gonna have to go.

Saravanabhavan S   1:10:59
But.

James Maki   1:11:09
We'll have to go find that task.

Saravanabhavan S   1:11:15
This one.

James Maki   1:11:16
You want to go to dev.azure.com instead of portal.azure.com dev.azure.com.

Saravanabhavan S   1:11:27
Actually, I don't have a. I think so.

James Maki   1:11:27
Yeah.
Oh, you don't have access yet, OK.
All right, that's OK. I can grab the link for you.
Here you go. I got it. I'm dropping it in the chat for you.
This.

Saravanabhavan S   1:12:33
It's OK if I write jobs.

James Maki   1:12:36
Yes. Yep, that's right. And then, so you do need to fill out some of the other stuff. Yeah, so it's gonna be a task.

Manjunath S   1:12:44
I.

James Maki   1:12:48
Yeah, category rules engines.

Saravanabhavan S   1:12:48
OK.

Manjunath S   1:12:50
Right.

James Maki   1:12:53
And it's being escalated to development. Yep.
The the company name is also in the top left up next to the to the user's name.
Just FYI. But yeah, so that that that's good. Yeah. So task is created so you can put it on hold.

Saravanabhavan S   1:13:23
And he put it down onward.

James Maki   1:13:25
Yep.

Manjunath S started transcription

James Maki   0:04
Go ahead and pull it, pull it up whenever you're ready.

Manjunath S   0:04
Yeah, yes.
Yeah, actually yesterday we saw that that that is some source regarding the.
Resets.
This one lives.

James Maki   0:37
All right, did you look on the server?

Manjunath S   0:40
Yeah, I just looked on the server, but uh, there is no receipts for the particular date.
So if there is no receipts on the server, we can download it right from the SQL query.

James Maki   1:25
All right. Uh.
So when we looked at this before, like when when the receipts were delayed, they were downloaded like the following day.
Or like as soon as like the issue was resolved and like the queue got cleared like they started downloading so they just had like a different date on them. So what you need to do is you need to verify the disputes or you need to look for the disputes that were completed on that day.

Manjunath S   1:44
Yeah.

James Maki   1:54
So you can do that inside Sonnet. You can do a search for the ones that were completed that day. From there you can get you can get the control numbers.

Manjunath S   2:00
Mhm.

James Maki   2:03
And then you can go look in the receipts folder and see if there was a receipt for that control number.

Manjunath S   2:18
Now for in the times images there are like uh missing the 16th.
After 15 there is no date in the 60.

James Maki   2:31
Yeah, so did the images from the 16th, did they get mixed in with the ones from the 17th?

Manjunath S   2:36
Yeah.

James Maki   2:40
Are you're saying yes, but.

Manjunath S   2:43
No, no, no. I'm saying like there is no images for the date 16.

James Maki   3:07
All right, so if the files were delayed, then they might just be there under a different day. So the files aren't there from the 16th, but maybe they got moved over on the 17th when whatever happened was resolved.
So what you need to do is over and sonnet. You need to go search for the disputes received that day.

Manjunath S   3:22
Yes.

James Maki   3:29
And you need to find some with images.
Well, I would do it from the search screen.
And I'm looking for a solid received date on the 16th.

Manjunath S   3:53
So not date completed or received it.

James Maki   3:56
No, we're looking for a received date.

Manjunath S   3:58
OK.

James Maki   4:03
So the image attachments are downloaded with the dispute, so those should be received on the same day that dispute that the disputes are received.

Manjunath S   4:11
16th and 16th both are same.

James Maki   4:13
Right.
And then we also want to look just for the ones with images.
Yep. All right, so let's search for that.
OK.
Yes.
Uh, all right.
Uh, so from here.
Now we need to we need to track these images and see.
If they were ever moved over to the server, so let's go into one of these disputes. Doesn't matter which one.
And we're gonna copy the control number.
Right, and this is an Experian dispute, so that tells us what folder the image file should be in. So now we can go. So now we can go back over to the server.

Manjunath S   5:16
OK.

James Maki   5:24
But right now you're in the TransUnion folder. We're looking for experience, so you need to go up a level.
And then go into the Exterian folder.

Manjunath S   5:38
Yes.
Hello.

James Maki   5:51
Uh.
No, you don't really need to do that. So we're so we're looking for a specific file, so so you can just do find.

Manjunath S   5:59
OK.

James Maki   6:08
Space star.
For wild card and then 'cause the control number is at the end of the file names, so we do the star in front and then you can paste in and paste in the control number.
And then it should end in dot tiff.
Because these are relative files.
All right, so run that and let's see if it finds anything.
OK, there it is. OK, so the file is there. Uh.
So let's do LS dash LTR so we can look at all the files in order by date.
All right, and so now, so now we know the file's there, so it should be probably between the 16th and the 17th, or we know there's nothing there from the 16th, right? So I'm guessing it's probably on the 17th. So if we scroll up into the 17th, let's see if we can find that control number.

Manjunath S   6:58
Yeah.

James Maki   7:12
Uh, just to verify.
So, alright, so what's the control number we're looking for?

Manjunath S   7:24
Control number.

James Maki   7:27
Yeah, yeah, we're we're just gonna look through the list and see if we can find it, 'cause it should be here in the 17th, probably.
So let's just kind of scan through here and see if we find it. So what's the number? What are we looking for?

Manjunath S   7:43
246424.

James Maki   7:46
Right. And that ends in 6016, right?
So it's usually easier to look at the end of the oh, if you're looking at the beginning, that's also fine. All right, it looks like. All right, I think I see it. Yeah, right there on the 448 up one. Oh, look at that. And there is images there from the 16th.
So what? Wait, what did she say on the ticket again?

Manjunath S   8:18
France images from 16th and.

James Maki   8:21
Oh, specifically TransUnion, OK.
OK, shoot. OK, all right. In that case, let's go back to Sonnet. So we're tracking the wrong thing, apparently. So return to dispute queue. Or actually, actually, it's better to hit the back button because we want your.
Uh, that's fine. Alright, put your search criteria back in.
Uh, so looking on the 16th.
And only with images.
Then.
Is there a?
Oh, credit Bureau. Select TransUnion.
Alright, and now let's search.
OK, so there were no.
There were no disputes with images for TransUnion on the 16th. OK, so she's actually not missing anything there because there just were no files.
OK, all right. And what were the receipts that she was missing?
It was like.

Manjunath S   9:39
What is it on 13th and 15th?

James Maki   9:48
OK.
13th through the 15th. OK, all right. So all of those receipts, OK.
OK, let's reset your search.
So just start a new one.
Alright, and this time let's search for completed date.
And she says it's the 13th through the 15th.
Which is a weekend, OK.
All right, all right. Uh, let's search for that.

Manjunath S   10:27
Oh, with images.

James Maki   10:30
No, we don't need that for this.
Because, because receipts get get generated for all disputes, not just the ones with images. We were using that before because we were focused on those Transunion images.
Alright, so they did have some here on the 13th.
OK.
Um, all right. Uh, let's uh.
Right click on one of those and open it in a new tab.
I think it'll be easier for us to.
Uh, try clicking on the ID. Right click on the ID.
So did I give you that option? That's weird.

Manjunath S   11:17
No.

James Maki   11:17
OK, OK. All right. Never mind. All right, let's just go into it then.

Manjunath S   11:20
Oh.
Or shall we open this unit in Nagar Hotel?

James Maki   11:33
No, it's OK. Let's just go into this view.
And let's look at the account history and that should tell us when the receipt was generated.

Manjunath S   11:50
Is it generated on 16?

James Maki   11:52
OK, all right, so that's what we thought.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   11:54
Go back, go back on the consumer tab again.
And.
OK, this issue is fixed. The account now is getting green. I saw somewhere that someone is still reporting that issue like still driving. Uh.
I just finished reviewing all the open tickets. Moving to pending tickets now.

James Maki   12:26
OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   12:26
I just joined because I was getting bored alone, working alone.

James Maki   12:30
No problem.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   12:34
Back to work, but I'll keep updating the tickets.

James Maki   12:35
Right. All right. Well, so, all right. So actually, it still happens to me.
So hold on before, before you, before you tell them it's fixed. So I'm just so.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   12:46
No, I am not telling anyone it's fixed. I saw a ticket where it was said it is not. They're still facing this problem.

James Maki   12:53
Yeah, yeah. So I still see it too. So I'm just over here in the demo company.
And look, it's going back to red. So it is. It is still happening, at least sometimes. Oh, you know what? I think it's because the dispute that he's on is a completed dispute. So it's so it's already green because it's dispute submitted.
So that one like shouldn't really go back to.
I mean, yeah.
So it's not it's not fixed.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:26
But it is not because it is not fixed, right?

James Maki   13:28
Oh, oh, oh, hold on. But here, this one's not doing it. This one is staying green.
This is just another dispute here in the demo company.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:44
Sorry I delayed the problem while investigating.

James Maki   13:54
Yeah, it's still happening here.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   13:58
I observed one common thing. Both had one block notifications.

James Maki   14:04
Oh.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   14:12
Related, not related, I don't know.
This one that one did not know.

James Maki   14:19
Yeah, see, can find one that here. Here's one that doesn't have a block notification.
Nope, that's doing it too.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   14:30
I don't even know the use case for it.

James Maki   14:34
Yeah, I don't either.
I thought it was across the board, but what was the one that I was in?
Sorry.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   14:47
OK, you guys carry on. I'm so sorry.

James Maki   14:50
All right, no problem, Cigar.
Alright.
Uh, where were we?

Manjunath S   15:02
Um, looking on the account tab history.

James Maki   15:07
Yes, OK, yes. And we saw the receipt was generated on the 16th. So what I would, so I would tell her the receipts from those days were generated on the 16th and so they have that, so they have that date.

Manjunath S   15:10
Um.
Yes.

James Maki   15:23
Because because when the receipt generates, it just uses whatever the current date is like it does. It doesn't go back to like what the actual completed date was, it just uses the current date. So so her files are there. She's just.

Manjunath S   15:23
Yeah.

James Maki   15:40
Not understanding which ones they are.
Sir, are you good to respond on that?

Manjunath S   15:49
Yes James, but what is my notice if the it's showing like receipt is generated on the 16th right? So in the server also it will be on the same date or it will be in next.

James Maki   15:57
Yes.
Yeah, on the server it'll have, yeah 'cause it has the date in the middle of the file name. So on on the server it'll it'll show as the 16th.

Manjunath S   16:08
Yes.

James Maki   16:13
Because that's when the receipt was generated.

Manjunath S   16:15
OK.
So.
So we check for this 13th also or just I responded.

James Maki   16:26
We already did that. There were there were no.

Manjunath S   16:28
OK.

James Maki   16:32
There were no Trans Union images on that day.

Manjunath S   16:57
E.

James Maki   17:32
Do you have another ticket we can look at? We only have a few more minutes before me. Me and Sabrina need to jump on another call, but.

Saravanabhavan S   17:42
James 22933.

Manjunath S   17:58
Is it good or should I change any sentences?

James Maki   18:06
You're not sharing your screen right now. I took it from you to show to to show a to show a cigar, that thing.

Manjunath S   18:10
Oh, it's so.
Yeah.
Yeah.

James Maki   18:32
Yeah, so I would explain to her. So on your second sentence there about the receipts, those dates were generated on the 16th and so they show that date like you need to tell her what to look for.
Like you're just saying that they were generated, but there's nothing there on the server from those dates. Like, she's not gonna understand that, right? So you have to, yeah, so you have to explain they were generated, but they show as being from the 16th.

Manjunath S   18:54
Oh.

James Maki   19:02
Yeah, so so you're right. So generate on the 16th and show that date instead of the completed date.

Manjunath S   19:23
Yeah.

James Maki   19:25
Yeah. OK. All right. Yeah, that's good.

Manjunath S   19:29
Uh, pending.

James Maki   19:31
Yeah, yeah, pending 'cause we need her to confirm that she understands what we're saying.
Yeah, right. And then real quick, the one that Servon asked about 22933.

Saravanabhavan S   19:49
Yes, Williams.

James Maki   19:50
So this is for CBH so.
All right, so there's a screen. There's a company screen that we can look at.
To see like to check their downloads, to check their downloads.

Saravanabhavan S   20:06
Yeah.
I'll just wait on this one.

Manjunath S   20:13
Oh, false. OK.
Set on a sharing.

Saravanabhavan S   20:22
This I'm connecting the just waiting.

Manjunath S   20:26

Saravanabhavan S   20:47
Yes.

James Maki   21:04

No.

Saravanabhavan S   21:18
So like see.

James Maki   21:20
You went to a different CBH. There was two. You went. You went to the wrong one. See, you're at Hudson Valley.
No, you want the bottom one, Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   21:38
OK then Sir.

James Maki   21:38
OK. All right. So we're showing no disputes received today. So if you go, yeah, so if you go over to the admin side, there is a downloads tab.

Saravanabhavan S   21:44
Yes.

James Maki   21:54
And that will show you like their recent download history.
Up at the top, there's a tab. Nope on the on the company. Scroll back up.

Oh, this.

James Maki   22:06
To the right. There you go. Yep.

Saravanabhavan S   22:06
View downloads.

James Maki   22:11
So this is their recent download history. So this will show you all the totals that we have downloaded for them. So we have not received any disputes for them for a while now actually.

Saravanabhavan S   22:17
OK.
Yes, well.

James Maki   22:25
So, yeah, and so I wanna say, I can't remember. I think these guys said that they were gonna stop credit reporting. So like, I think they're winding down. But yes, so we can, so we can see the dates there. So they were asking about like the last few days.

Saravanabhavan S   22:41
And.

James Maki   22:41
And yes, we can confirm that no disputes were received.

Saravanabhavan S   22:45

Manjunath S started transcription

James Maki   0:03
In that, but yeah, but if but if we need to, we can go back in and just disable the user.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:11
OK, OK.

James Maki   0:11
But normally, yeah, but I but I really don't even see the point in doing that because like as as soon as they stop using it, like if they don't log in for what is it like 30 days? If they don't log in, it'll go inactive automatically. So I really don't. Yeah, so I don't see much reason.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:24
OK.

James Maki   0:26
To actually have to do that manually.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:30
Got it. Cool.

James Maki   0:32
Yeah, yeah. Unless she, unless she has like some reason for that.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:39
OK, I'll create a request for that right away and for other one as well.

James Maki   0:45
Good.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   0:46
I'll update the ticket with the private comment with the RFC number.

James Maki   0:55
Right.
All right.
See.
All right. Either Manju or Supriya, either one of you want to drive. We're we're gonna get into the dev environment and and we're gonna see if we can set up these new companies.
So in the past in the dev environment, sometimes I've seen like error messages come up like trying to create a company like something about the.
Like the way that it's inserting in the company, like how it's supposed to go up.
Like the the company ID is supposed to go up like 100 for like the next ID or whatever. Something about that iteration. Sometimes it gets kind of messed up.
So we'll we're gonna try and see if it works and and hopefully we won't get any kind of error here.
So we're gonna go over to the dev environment whenever you're ready.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   2:22
So the user needs to be created first in Sonnet before applying the K2 changes, right?

James Maki   2:28
I mean, it doesn't have to be, but the the Cato's, yeah, the Cato's completely separate. So like the white listing can be done before that, but but pretty much everything else has to be done afterwards.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   2:31
OK.
OK, OK.

James Maki   2:40
Yeah, but but white white listing can be done at any time though.
Alright, so you are currently over in Azure and that's actually not what we're going right now. We're going to the dev environment.
Yes.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   3:30
I have sent you in check check once.

James Maki   3:40
Just put put the web address in the chat for you.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   3:40
Of.

James Maki   5:24
Alright, you're in. OK, alright, go over to the to the admin side, go over to the organizations.
Uh, and that's where we're going to.
Uh, try and add the new company.
But doesn't matter which one we do first. Cigar doesn't look like that. Looks like Velocity is probably the older ticket, so I guess.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   5:49
I'm creating the velocity one route now the RFC.

James Maki   6:04
Alright, uh.
So Manji, the the ticket that we're gonna use for this is gonna be a 22586.
For uh, Velocity is the company.
Right. All right. So.
Channel partner from Infinity building the API interface. OK, alright, so over in the dev environment we are going to.
Try and create. So in the top right corner there's the add new customer.
Yep, so we're gonna use that.
All right, so organization is going to be velocity.
Yeah, I can just copy that out the ticket.
Yeah, you can do Fen V Velocity if you want, yeah.
Right. And then the e-mail domain. So I think I you can copy it from the e-mail addresses were right there, right? You can copy it from from one of those. Yeah, the finv.com.
Alright, so you just want the domain. So take out like you don't need an actual person's name and you don't need the at symbol, you just want the domain.
Yeah, all right. Location for these guys. I don't know if it honestly it doesn't really matter for dev environment.
This is for Finvy. Where are those guys located? Alright, so they're in.
Let's see, can we find an actual location for these guys?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:18
Dev James, Quick question. Sorry.

James Maki   8:20
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:21
This there are for Fenways. There are two IPS for one is for API dev which is AWS correct. Then for dev UI VDI workstation access the same that is also in AWS.

James Maki   8:37
Yes, yeah. So all three of those will have to be whitelisted in AWS. Like any any connection to the dev environment needs to be whitelisted there. But then those workstation ones, those are the two that need to be whitelisted for user access inside Sonnet.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:45
OK.
OK, so these are.

James Maki   8:53
Uh, so so that.
Yeah.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   8:55
But again, those two, those two needs to be whitelisted on AWS or no?

James Maki   9:00
They do, yeah. They need to be whitelisted on both. Yeah, AWS and and insights on it.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   9:03
OK.
OK, got it. Got it. Thanks.

James Maki   9:06
Yep.
Yeah, no problem. All right, since this is just dev environment, let's not really worry about the location module. Let's just put like a.
Let's just put something like New York, NY.

Manjunath S   9:27
In New York.

James Maki   9:27
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. And then a collection system does. What options does it give us there?

Manjunath S   9:45
API TCS SIM exchange.

James Maki   9:48
Alright, Infinity's not in there anywhere. Oh, TCS. Well, no, actually, no, don't use that. Don't use that because that's actually something specific.
OK, uh.
Uh, let's just say like API.
So I kind of at the top there. Yeah, let's just do that. That works. All right, let's, let's create and let's see if it works.

Manjunath S   10:11
Yeah.

James Maki   10:22
Perfect. OK, it worked. Awesome. Excellent.

Manjunath S   10:22
Yes.

James Maki   10:26
All right. So we have our company now. All right. So what's our?
Uh, let's go back to the ticket and let's see our next steps.
The creation of disputes.

Manjunath S   10:41
That's right.

James Maki   10:47
OK.
Uh, alright.
All right, so Sigar, are you you're creating the SSD ticket for those those IP addresses? Are are you doing that? OK, cool. All right, so I would wait until we get confirmation that that's completed to set up the users.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   11:10
Already done. Done.

James Maki   11:18
Just 'cause if you do it before then, like they're gonna log in and then they're they're gonna get blocked, right? So I would do the user creation. I would do that last.
So let's focus on setting up some disputes and let's see.
We can get you guys started on that. All right, so over in our in our shared documents drive, there's a yeah, there's a dev environment folder.

Manjunath S   11:44
The folder.

James Maki   11:52
All right, so you need to copy.
You need to copy that bottom file that that dot Pim. You need to have that saved locally and I would put it in its own folder so that you have it separated from everything.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and download it.

Manjunath S   12:13
OK, should I download it?

James Maki   12:20
All right, and then I think we saw like you, you're not able to like create a desktop folder, right? So I think you had to do it here inside your downloads. So let's create like a dev folder.

Manjunath S   12:26
Uh.

James Maki   12:34
OK.

Manjunath S   12:37
A new folder.

James Maki   12:38
Yeah, yeah, let's create a new folder.

Manjunath S   12:57
Yes, yes.

James Maki   12:59
Oh, cool. You can do it on your desktop now. Awesome. All right. OK, yeah, all right. So let's let's paste that file in here. The dot, the dot PIM file.

Manjunath S   13:00
Yeah.

James Maki   13:18
All right. And then did you guys get the bash software installed? Do you have that?

Manjunath S   13:24
Which one, James?

James Maki   13:25
Bash the get bash software.
I know we talked about it in the past.
Yeah, so like if you, yeah, OK, so I guess so like if you right click here in this folder, you should see an option. If it's installed, you should have an option to get back here. All right. And I do not not on the file, just like on a blank. Yeah, just like anywhere in the folder.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   13:36
We have.

Manjunath S   13:38
Oh.
Yeah.

James Maki   13:52
There we go. All right, so yeah, open GitBash here.

Manjunath S   13:54
Yeah.
Mm.

James Maki   14:00
Yeah, Yep, that one. All right, so this is opening up your bash software inside of the folder that you are that you are in. Like it's exactly where you opened it.
So I'm gonna send you a command. Hello. Well, alright, that's still not coming up yet.

Manjunath S   14:23
Just comment.

James Maki   14:24
Oh yeah, yeah, that whole thing.
The whole thing, everything from the very beginning to the end.
Including the SSH. Yep, there you go. OK, all right, so on your BIOS software. OK, cool. All right, so now it's open, so you can paste that there.

Manjunath S   14:37
Yeah, yeah, got it.

James Maki   14:47
And then we have to, so we need to kind of edit that, right? Because if you look at the command that's looking in the way that that's set up for me, the location that I have that folder is in my users, James Mackie desktop. So yours is different so.
All right, so we need to edit that to match your folder location.
Which for you, this is on a OneDrive. All right, so you are in. So it's kind of at the top there, like you see like in the top of the window. Like for you, it's C drive users slash your name slash OneDrive. Yeah, so you so you want to.

Manjunath S   15:25
Yeah.

James Maki   15:29
You wanna put that into?

Manjunath S   15:32
This comment.

James Maki   15:32
Uh, like, yeah, yeah, like replace James Mackey slash desktop. Replace that with your name slash OneDrive.
Alright, and then your folder is not named dev, it's just new folder, right? So you also wanna change that.
So it needs to be exact. So currently there's a space after new and then the F is lowercase.
There you go. OK, all right, let's run that and let's see if that works.

Manjunath S   16:25
Accessible.

James Maki   16:25
Not accessible. All right, so we got the folder. We got the folder path wrong, so go to your folder.
All right, so we we need the full. We need the folder path for this.
So like what? What do we have wrong here?
Alright, we need the folder path like we need the location like the the file itself doesn't matter right now. We need to know where that new folder that you're in. We need the full path to that.

Manjunath S   17:10
OK.

James Maki   17:16
You keep clicking on the file, but that's not what we need right now. We need the folder paths.
So like in the top where it says new folder, we need that path. Like how do we get? We need the full path for that. There we go. All right, go ahead and copy that. Yeah, yeah, copy that. OK, so it looks like the way that OneDrive is named. All right, I guess it.

Manjunath S   17:28
This one, right? Yeah.

James Maki   17:37
That whole Pravana, Pravana, India, PVTI guess all that's part of it. Alright, so let's go back to our command.
And let's just hit up. So it works the same way as, yeah, like when you're on the server, like it stores your last like your command history so you can get back to it. All right, so let's take out.
I guess everything. Do we just take out everything there?

Manjunath S   18:11
Yes, James, so.

James Maki   18:11
And and and paste. Or did you did you paste that in? You you pasted it. You didn't go up. You paste. OK.

Manjunath S   18:16
Yeah, yeah. I just pasted it. No, no, I just pasted it, yeah.

James Maki   18:21
Alright, so let's go over to the beginning and you have to add in the SSH space dash I in front.
Cool.
Let's keep it capitalized for right now. All right. And then you and then you need that file name. So after, yeah, so new folder.

Manjunath S   18:39
See.

James Maki   18:51
Then it's gonna be, oh, the.
Do we have the slashes?
The slashes are also facing the wrong way. We have back slashes in that folder path and we need forward slashes.
Yeah, so we need we need to replace all those slashes as a.
Yeah, that's forward. Yep.
All right, and then you need one more, one more forward slash at the after folder and then you need to copy that that EC to access dot PIM file name. You need you need that.
So everything after folder in the yeah in the in the top line, everything after folder you need to copy.
Yeah, all the way just to the to the.com. Yeah, at the end of that line.
Yeah, all right. Copy that, paste that, and let's try again. Let's run it.
Is it running? There we go. What's it say? Those name contains invalid characters. Jeez. All right.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Can we move the folder? Is there anywhere else that we can put it? Like can can we actually put that on your local machine somewhere? Not not on OneDrive.

Manjunath S   21:50
OK.
So we create it in downloads.

James Maki   22:06
Yeah, yeah, let's try that.

Manjunath S   22:09
No, not at all.

James Maki   22:13
All right, go ahead and change the name, change it from new folder, change it to dev or like whatever you want to call it, but change it from new folder.
All right.
OK, alright, let's try opening up opening up Dashroom here.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   22:39
Me.
Don't expect the RFCS to be completed today, OK? Because it needs to go through 2 approvals.

James Maki   22:50
Uh.
The white listing, OK.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   22:59
Yes, because it will go through my immediate supervisor's, what do you call approval and then IT director's approval. So two steps, so most probably tomorrow.

James Maki   23:10
OK.
All right.
It's fine.
Alright, so if you hit hit up on your keyboard and it should give us the last commands.

Manjunath S   23:33
No, James.

James Maki   23:34
Is it not? It's not finding it. It's weird, OK?

Manjunath S   23:36
No.

James Maki   23:40
All right, copy the copy the command from chat again and this time the this time the only thing that we have to change is is the name like your name and then change desktop to download or downloads.

Manjunath S   23:46
Yeah.

James Maki   23:58
And then and hopefully that's.
No.
Yeah, alright, let's try that.

Manjunath S   24:16
Try to run.

James Maki   24:18
Yeah, you can just hit enter. Yeah, let's see if it works this time.
There we go. That's what we wanted. All right. So yes.
Perfect. All right, you are officially on the dev server.
All right, so the 1st place that we are going to go is we are going to create an images directory so you can go to slash sonnet slash images.

Manjunath S   25:13
Enter.

James Maki   25:13
Yep. Yep.
All right, and if you list out the contents here, you will see a folder for all the companies that have been using the dev environment.
All right, so whenever disputes get generated, this is where the the images that we generate along with them, this is where they go. So there needs to be a folder here for every client that you're setting up.
So for this one, let's see, they didn't really give us.
Uh.
There's not a Fin V folder, right? OK, there's not good. All right, so we're going to use Fin V as the abbreviation. So you do want to do the pseudosus on it. You do want to do that first. You are going to need this on it access for everything that we're going to do here on the dev environment.
Yeah, go ahead and do that. And then we're going to make a new directory, so it's MKDIR.
Right. And we're gonna make this for Finvy. It's gonna be the name.
All right, Yep.
All right, you do that.
So this part is very similar to like setting up an API client in production. So you're essentially doing all the same steps, but everything is on this one server and there's not multiple that you're going to have to go to. So that's the good news. All right, so next. All right, so you've made the folder.
So we do want to check the permissions on it. So if you list out the contents again, we want to make sure that the left hand column, we want to make sure that that matches for the new folder, that it matches all the other ones.
And it looks like it does.
Right. Perfect. Right. And then the last thing that you need for.

Manjunath S   27:26
This one.

James Maki   27:28
Yep, Yep, that's the one. And so the the folder permissions are the left column, that DRWXR, all that stuff. That's like the read write permissions is what all that stands for. So yeah, so you just want to make sure that all that matches the other the other folders.
And it does. So you're good. Oh, there is actually one thing though, the group. So the FINV folder, you notice it says kind of in the middle columns, it says Sonnet and then Sonnet again, but all the other ones say Sonnet and then WWW dash data.
So that is kind of that's like the folder owner or like the group that owns the folder. So we do actually want to change that.
And to do that.
You are going to run.
Alright, so the command that we're gonna run for this is gonna be change owner, so it's gonna be CHOWN.
So it's kind of a it's abbreviating change owner. All right, that's the command. The next thing we're going to tell it is oh, what we want to set it to. So we're going to do sonnet and then space and then the WWW dash data.
And the last thing we need to tell it is what we are setting that for and that is going to be for finvy. So do another space and then finvy.
And that should work. Let's do that.
Right.
Uh, no, that's for a file.
OK, it's a different.
I haven't done this for a while. How did I do this?
One second, let me find my command here.

Manjunath S   30:31
So Biggie was pseudo before the gyms.

James Maki   30:36
No, you're already pseudoed into the Sonnet user, so you don't need to do another pseudo.
Oh, OK.
I got it.
All right, I'll just put the command in the chat for you.
So I had the formatted wrong. It's supposed to be a colon between the user and the group, and then also since this is a directory, not a file, we needed the the dash R switch which is what tells it that it's a a folder and not a file.
Yeah. So let's go ahead and run that and that should work for us.
Operation not permitted, really, even as a Sana user. OK, alright, alright, let's do it one more time. And this time do like you said, let's put pseudo in front of it.

Manjunath S   32:15
Like.

James Maki   32:16
Yeah, let's try that.

Manjunath S   32:22
Got it.

James Maki   32:22
See, this is what? All right, do control C to control C to cancel that because we do not have like that's asking for like the admin password, like the admin password for the sonnet user and we don't have that.
All right, exit out of the Sonnet user and then let's run that command again.

Manjunath S   32:49
The one you sent in the chat.

James Maki   32:51
Yeah, yeah, exit out the sonnet user.

Manjunath S   33:05
Exit.

James Maki   33:06
Mm-hmm.
And then let's run it one more time with with the pseudo there.
OK, alright, looks like it successfully ran that time. Alright, let's list out the contents and see if the update went through.

Manjunath S   33:42
Yeah, it changed.

James Maki   33:42
Right. All right. There we go. Now we got it. OK.
All right, so yeah, so changing folder permissions. Can't do it from the Sonnet user. Have to do it from from yours. OK, let's go back to this. Let's pseudo back into Sonnet. So pseudo Sudsonnet again now that that's done.
In this time.
And this time we're we're going to copy those those green TIF files. We're going to copy those into the folder. So those are our templates for creating images. So those need to be in each like in every company folder.

Manjunath S   34:11
This.

James Maki   34:26
In order to in order to generate the images, so pseudosus on it again, you're gonna have to go back to that user.
Yeah.
All right, and we're going to copy all of the TIF files into the affinity folder. So easiest way to do that is going to be a CP for copy and then we're going to do a space star dash TIF.

Manjunath S   35:07
Or dash this.

James Maki   35:08
Oh, sorry, dud start dot tiff dot dash.

Manjunath S   35:13
No.

James Maki   35:15
Yeah, dot dot if.
There we go. Alright, and we're gonna put it into the affinity folder. Uh, so we'll do another space.

Manjunath S   35:28
Henry.

James Maki   35:30
Alright.
I think you need to do a period forward slash finvy because what you're saying is you're going to copy it into this local folder is what the period forward slash means, but then in there you want it to go into the finvy folder.
So it's saying from the current folder into the fin V directory you need a period in front of the forward slash because that's that's what tells it it's the local or like the like the current.
Yeah.
Uh, Nope. Other other signs, yeah.
There you go. All right, there we go. All right, go ahead and run that.
OK, so now if you go into the Infinity folder.
And list out the contents. You should see those dot tif files in there.

Manjunath S   36:24
It is Hindi.

James Maki   36:26
Uh, Yep.

Manjunath S   36:41
Yeah.

James Maki   36:41
And and there they are. Perfect. All right, so we've got our images. Yeah, so images directory is now set up. That's ready to go for the dispute creation. So now we're going to move on to that part. So the disputes are created from the sonnet forward slash.

Manjunath S   36:44
It's loading.

James Maki   37:00
Uh DB dash scripts folder.

Manjunath S   37:09
Sorry, judge Sonat.

James Maki   37:12
Yeah, so you need the CD. We're changing directories where we're going to a different folder.

Manjunath S   37:12
I.
Yes.
CD space Sonnet.

James Maki   37:21
Yep, Son it's the root folder, so we need the slash in front just like just like normal. Remember like whenever you're first going to.

Manjunath S   37:31
Oh.

James Maki   37:32
Like a our first folder. Yeah, alright, so slash sonnet slash DB dash scripts.
Oh yeah, you had it. Yep.
Cool. All right, let's go there. And if you list these out, you should see all of our automation scripts.
And there they are. All right. So my general practice has been whenever I'm creating disputes for a company, I typically give them all their own individual scripts. That way we can control their disputes, do like.
Create them however they want us to and we don't have to worry about affecting anybody else. All right, so.
The first scripts that we are gonna concentrate on are going to be the make under score API under under score scripts.
Excuse me, alright.

Manjunath S   38:39
Make under score API under score scripts.

James Maki   38:42
Well, we're we're just looking right now. We're we're just looking. I just want you to look at those. So like in in the list here, those are the scripts that we're gonna be kind of focused on for first. So these are the ones that actually generate the disputes.
So this is basically creating like our step one for example. That's what these scripts are doing. So what I generally do is I usually just copy one and then I'll go through and edit it for the new company.

Manjunath S   39:15
Yeah.

James Maki   39:15
So let's do and and I wanted to make a template for you guys. OK, and I did. OK, so there's a there's the make API template.
Yep, it's it's right after that group of three in the white. It's right after that. Yep. Yeah, right where, right where your cursor is. Yeah. All right. So we're gonna try and we're we're gonna use that. So go ahead and copy that file name.

Manjunath S   39:38
Yeah, here, please.

James Maki   39:48
All right, and we are going to copy the script. So just like we made the TIF files, we're going to do a CP for copy and then you can paste in that file name.
And then we're good. So that's what we're copying. So then now we're going to say what we're copied, like what our our new copy is going to be. So you can do a space and we're going to do a make under score API under score velocity.
Velocity.
I think they spelled it with an S, didn't they? Yeah, yeah, SIDY is how they spelled it.
So the the company name is what we're doing, right? So.
Oh, well, actually, you know what? I said velocity, but we made the folder Finvi, so maybe we should do that. No, let's keep it. All right. It's it's DYD as in dog.
That's how they spelled it.
They they gotta be creative.
All right, so let's go ahead and do that. All right, run that. And So what this is doing is this is making the the make API velocity. That script now exists and what it is currently is a copy of the API template, right?
So that's what we just did. So if you list out the contents again, you should now see that velocity script in there. Oh, you know what we forgot though is the dot PHP at the end.

Manjunath S   41:30
OK.

James Maki   41:32
OK, uh, go ahead, list out the contents.
And I think we'll have to remove that first one, see if we can find it. All right. Is it with the dot PHPS? It is. OK, so go ahead, copy that velocity.
Name and we're just gonna remove it to make API velocity that you just made.
It's right. It's right below the template.

Manjunath S   42:02
Well, that's it.
Oh, this one.

James Maki   42:12
Yeah.
All right, so we're just gonna do a RM and then paste that in.
And we'll just remove that.
Yeah.

Manjunath S   42:27
Oh.

James Maki   42:32
OK, all right. And then let's well, so the the command is in your history. So if you go up now, go up a couple, you'll see the copy command and this time we'll just add the dot PHP to the end. Yeah, yeah.

Manjunath S   42:32
So again I have to copy.
And.

James Maki   42:47
Perfect. Alright, run that and this time.
All right, and this time it should be good to go. All right, so if you list out the contents, we should see it there.
And there it is. All right, so let's go into that. So we're going to do a VI and into the script you just created.
All right, answer.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   43:31
Amran perform the changes OK for 924758. I don't know for what that SSD was for. Let me check.

James Maki   43:33
Oh.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   43:53
It can be a bit too. I think this is for velocity.

James Maki   43:59
Perfect.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   43:59
Yeah, velocity velocity is done.

James Maki   44:01
Excellent.
All right, so the first thing I like to do whenever I go into these scripts is I like to turn on the the line numbers so that I can see where I'm at in the scripts. So to do that it's a colon.
And then set.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, space num NUM.
Yep, right. And run that and that should turn on our line numbers.
Oh, is it set? Oh, actually it might be set new. I think it's just NU.

Manjunath S   44:51
New.

James Maki   44:52
Yeah, colon, yeah, colon, set, set in U, space in U.
Set space in you.
Take out the space after the colon. It needs to be all together.

Manjunath S   45:15
Select that new.

James Maki   45:18
Uh, yeah, yeah, hit her.
There we go. That's what I wanted. OK, alright, so this just helps with navigating the file, right? So you can see exactly where you're at.
And like, so like whenever there's an error, it should tell you like the line number that the error occurred on. So if you're ever having to troubleshoot.
That will have that will like help you see where the problem is in the script. All right, so the first thing that we want to change here is going to be the company ID, which is on line #11.
So currently that is set to 12,000 and we want to set that to our new company here, which is going to be 24600. So to change it you have to do all this like your mouse doesn't work here, so you have to use your keyboard.
And so you want to go down to line 11 and you're going to hit I for insert and that's what's going to allow you to make changes.

Manjunath S   46:25
Yeah.

James Maki   46:26
Yep. Yeah. So go ahead and hit I.

Manjunath S   46:33
OK.

James Maki   46:34
All right. And you see like on the bottom left-hand corner it says insert. So that tells you that you are now editing. You are now editing the script. So let's go over to the 12,000 and we're going to take that out and we're going to change it to 24600.

Manjunath S   46:39
Yeah.

James Maki   47:09
OK, all right, so that's the first change that we want to make. Another good habit that I that I do is whenever I'm not making changes, I hit escape to get out of the insert option.

Manjunath S   47:27
OK.

James Maki   47:30
There you go. All right, so now we're no longer editing. So now you don't have to worry about accidentally hitting like hitting the button and adding something somewhere and whatever. So just whenever you're not making changes, it's always good to get out of that insert function.
Just so you don't make any unwanted changes. All right, sure.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   47:49
James, good question.
I was on a call with Kamran now. So for Sunbit, the IP provided is a private IP. We would need the public IP, right?

James Maki   48:00
Uh, probably.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   48:03
OK, cool. I will request for the public IP on the ticket. Cool. Bye.

James Maki   48:08
OK, Yep. All right. Good catch.
Alright, so again, using your keyboard, let's kinda Scroll down here through the lines.
And let's see if there's anything else that we need to edit.
I don't believe so sometimes on the request like they'll tell you.
They'll give us like a little bit more specifics. Like one thing that they didn't say on this was how many disputes they wanted created.
So we're just gonna have to come up with a number that we think is gonna be good enough, right? So using your keyboard, let's let's move down through the file and let's look at these lines.
And see if there's anything else that we need to edit.

Manjunath S   49:07
To the account numbers.

James Maki   49:11
So we're actually not worried about those for this.
There's there's there's a lot of stuff in here that we're not gonna have to worry about. But yeah, so we're not gonna worry about that. So let's just keep going down.

Manjunath S   49:16
OK.

James Maki   49:27
And and somewhere down here should be a number of disputes to create.
There we go. Yeah, that's what I wanted. All right.
It's it's definitely a good idea for you guys to be like kind of noting these line numbers because these should be pretty much the same in most of the scripts. So this is where you're gonna be looking whenever you're setting up another new new company.
So, so please take note of these line numbers just for future reference. So 50 sounds like a good number, so I think we can leave that how it is.
Oh, and and the other thing to know about that. So it's saying disputes per day equals MT Rand. So that's like a random. It's basically selecting a random number. So if you wanted to change this.
Like say a say a company wants it, they want between 10 and 20 disputes every day. You would change that from 50 comma 50 to 10 comma 20 and then and then that's what kind of sets the the random number of disputes.
Additionally, we could take out that Mt rand altogether and just have disputes per day equal a set number. You can do that as well, and I have done that on a few scripts, so you will see that sometimes. And that's just like it says it's saying create this many disputes whenever the script runs.
So there's two different ways to kind of do that, but all right. So and then the next thing is right below that you'll notice organization ID, company ID again and team ID. All of those need to match the.
The proper company number, yes. So we're gonna change all three of those to 24600.

Manjunath S   51:30
So we change that.

James Maki   51:38
Uh, so you're gonna do your I to insert again.
And now you can edit.

Manjunath S   51:59
So again, escape or can we continue the downline?

James Maki   52:03
Oh, you you can just continue, yeah.
Yeah, it's really just like whenever you're like really kind of moving through the file and just like if you're looking for something, yeah, like if if you're in the place that you're gonna be making your edits, then yeah, you can definitely just do what you need to do before you escape again. But.
Alright, perfect. Alright, so that's good. So now you can escape and I think that is the last.
That should be the last variable that we're concerned with for today. Further down there is also an option to control how many images are are generated for a dispute. And so like I have had companies in the past saying like we usually do random.
So that it's like some some disputes get images and some don't and that way they get like a mix of both kind of situations, right? Because this is all for testing purposes. So we want, we want to give them like as many different scenarios as possible so they can test all the different.
Scenarios will work in disputes, so there's an option in there to control like the number of images that are set. And yeah, so if you ever do need to edit that, it is just further down and it'll look very similar to that number of disputes.
It'll look very similar to that, but it's it says images and I think that's down in like the two hundreds is like the line number for that. I think it's kind of far down there like so these these scripts are kind of big like there is a lot in here and that's that's probably why or that's the main reason why I love to turn on the the line numbers.
Just to help you keep track.
Yeah, keep going, keep going. I think it was like around, it's like around like 270 maybe somewhere around there, like I think it was pretty far down.

Manjunath S   53:56
200.

James Maki   54:06
There's duplicates.
Their attachments. Oh yeah, yeah, they called it attachments, not images. But yeah, but alright, and so it's.
Yeah. So that's doing like a bunch of kind of random stuff, right? Like, that's what I I don't know how good you guys are at reading scripts, but but yeah, so there's a lot going on there, right? But so on line 274, there's a.
Again, there's that random selector between zero to three, so if you want, yeah. So if you wanted to guarantee that they had images, you could just change that zero to a one, and that way there's always going to be at least one image for everything.

Manjunath S   54:40
Mhm.

James Maki   54:49
But we don't. We don't have to worry about that today, but but that's where you find that. All right, so that's the last change that we should have to make for right now. So to exit the script, it's just like whenever we're editing on the web 01 server. So we're going to do a colon, lowercase WQ.

Manjunath S   54:53
OK.
OK.
OK.

James Maki   55:08
For right and quit and that's gonna save, that's gonna save our changes.

Manjunath S   55:10
Uh huh.
It's colon WQ.

James Maki   55:17
Yep.

Manjunath S   55:23
Enter.

James Maki   55:23
Yes.
All right, OK, so that is our script to make the disputes. So now we can go ahead and run that and make sure we don't have any issues. So to do that, easiest way is you can just do to open your keyboard and just change that VI.
Uh, change that to PHP.
There you go. Alright, and let's run that.
And make sure we don't get any errors.
Looking good. Awesome.
Excellent. Perfect. All right, so that was easy. So now over in our dev environment, if you pull that up.

Manjunath S   56:24
Which one jumps development?

James Maki   56:25
Yeah, back in, yeah, sonnet dev. So if you go over there now, you should see those disputes.
Are created for the company.
Yeah, so if you just visit in's on it.
Yeah, you can just visit us on it. The big green button, top left.

Manjunath S   57:06
OK now.

James Maki   57:07
Oh, time timed out.
There you go. All right. Yeah. So actually, yeah, it doesn't matter, but we're so we're just gonna go over to the affinity company now.

Manjunath S   57:47
So not at.
Open the velocity.

James Maki   58:10
Yeah.
Oh, wait, no. So that's adding a company. You don't want to do that. That's not what we're doing here. So pay attention to what you're doing because you're saying add a company to Fin V Velocity and that's not what we're trying to do. So this is, so this is an old version of Sonnet.
I do need to point that out for you guys. Yeah. So yeah, on the new version of Sonnet, that's like a filter, right? And that does, yeah. And that's where you go, like to find the company. But yeah, so in this environment, yeah, it was a different function that was there. So yeah, so you can either do a control F.
To to find or if you just want to go.
Or you can also just go to Sonnet and.
And to go to him over there either way.

Manjunath S   58:55
Control from here.

James Maki   58:57
Uh, yeah. So now if you type Infinity, we'll.
There it is.

Manjunath S   59:03
Yeah.

James Maki   59:05
And there. Alright, so now let's let's go into the company.
And then visits on it.
And you'll see the disputes are in the step one queue now. Alright, so yeah, so so those are the the disputes that you just created.

Manjunath S   59:17
Yeah, whatever.

James Maki   59:22
So that's how you can verify that that's done. All right, so that part is now taken care of.
So now back on our ticket.
They did give us a list of users to set up, so Sagar already told us that the whitelisting has been completed for dev, so we can go ahead and set those users up.
Just like normal.

Manjunath S   59:59
This useless.

James Maki   59:59
Yeah, those users. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're ready to set all those guys up.

Manjunath S   1:00:02
OK, yeah, this is.
A.

James Maki   1:00:08
Uh, uh. But before we do that, uh, let's still.
Do our last thing. Um.
So they wanna put this on a schedule. So there's there's still one more thing that we need to do on the server for this.
Uh, so if you go back over to that.
Over to the server we we need to, we need to set a schedule for these guys.
Yeah, all right. And I.
Yes, all right. So this is some, this is some pretty advanced stuff that we're doing here, but all right, so schedules are are controlled by cron jobs and cron jobs are set up on the cron tab.
So to view that, you're already pseudoed into the Sonnet user, but whenever you're coming in to look at the schedule, you do need to make sure you're on the Sonnet user because all of these run.
Using that user, right? So that's the owner for all this. So to view the crontab, the command is crontab space dash L.

Manjunath S   1:01:30
App spatial.

James Maki   1:01:33
Dash L it is Crontab CRON.
OK. Yeah. Dash L, that's it. All right. Hit enter and that'll give us or that'll show us all of our cron jobs. All right. So these are all the schedules that we have set up. Any line that has the pound sign in front of it is commented out.
So that means that it's not actually running currently. So like TBF Financial for example, there's that pound sign in front of their schedule. So that means that it is not in fact running, it's turned off.
So anything that doesn't have that pound sign is of course running. So Continental Finance has schedules still running. Northridge has schedules still running. Anyone. There's just a couple more in there. And so here you can actually use your mouse and you can kind of scroll up some.
And there is a kind of a top to this list.
Yeah, right. Yeah. So there's our top or like the the beginning of our of our Chrome tab.
So like there is some some general kind of scripts that are that looks like they're not currently running, but there's like that sonnet one. So that's the one that we we used to use back when the dev environment was.
Really just used for like a completely different purpose. Um.
But OK, so this is where we are going to set up a schedule.
Uh, so the easiest way to do that is to find one that we can copy.
So we're looking for just like a general one that doesn't have like account numbers listed and that kind of thing.
All right, let's use the.
Uh, let's use the Northridge one. Let's use uh.
So right below Northridge creating 100 disputes daily, right below that is going to be their creation scripts. So if you will copy that starts with A9 space six, copy that whole line.
Uh, right below Northridge.
Yeah, the the next one down. Yeah, that first one.
The 9/6 up up to up two lines. Yeah, that one. There you go. All right. Yeah. So go ahead and copy that. And what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to add a new section here for velocity.

Manjunath S   1:04:11
Samiya.

James Maki   1:04:27
And we're just going to kind of tweak that to use the to use the command that you just created. All right, so so this is just listing out the crontab. You can't actually make any changes from here. So the way to actually make changes is to do crontab dash E.
Instead of L so you can hit up on your keyboard and we're just gonna change that L to an E.

Manjunath S   1:04:56
OK.

James Maki   1:04:59
Yeah.
Yep. Yeah. So this is going to be editing the cron tab. That's what the E is for. So you can go and hit enter and it's going to pull up the cron tab again. But this time it's going to be very colorful. So when you see it very colorful, that means that you are making changes.
So just be very careful that you're not making any changes that you don't intend to make. So let's add these guys. All right, so it's starting at the top this time instead of at the bottom like it does when it's just listing. So let's go down.
And we are going to add a line. Let's do it after Continental Finance.
Yeah, so if you go to, we're gonna, we're gonna add our new scripts. We're gonna add that. Let's do it after Continental Finance. So using your keyboard, go down.

Manjunath S   1:05:47
Sorry, thanks.

James Maki   1:06:02
Yeah, all right. And and after Continental Finance, you can go to that post data. Yeah, you can start there and hit enter. Hit it like twice at above above the post data. I mean, it doesn't really matter, but let's do it there.

Manjunath S   1:06:18
OK.
Yeah, from here twice.

James Maki   1:06:25
Uh.
Go down one because you want to keep all those together. Yeah, there hit enter twice. So that's gonna add 2 lines for us.
Oh, oh, sorry, you have to hit I first. You have to answer it again.
There. Now hit enter twice. Yeah. All right. And now go up one and let's paste in or actually, sorry, let's not paste yet. So let's do. So we're kind of naming our section here. So we want to, we want to follow the same format all these other ones are doing.

Manjunath S   1:06:47
Oh.

James Maki   1:07:05
So let's do pound sign, space, pound sign and then fin V velocity.

Manjunath S   1:07:14
One time.

James Maki   1:07:16
Yeah, like the number sign pound, like see like all the other ones, all the blue lines. See how they all start with the pound sign.

Manjunath S   1:07:22
OK, uh, semi colon dot.

James Maki   1:07:25
That's not a semi colon, it's it's a pound sign.
Like the number 3 shift shift 3.

Manjunath S   1:07:34
Oh, OK.

James Maki   1:07:36
Yeah, that one. There you go. All right. And so follow the same format. So all these other ones, like the way that they're labeled, we want to keep it uniform so they all look like they match. So space and then another pound sign.
And then space. And let's call this. Yeah, yeah, let's do fin V velocity. Let's give it the full name. So anyone, anyone else that comes in here, they can tell exactly what it is, right? Is what we're is what the goal is here.

Manjunath S   1:07:53
Can we?
Yes.

James Maki   1:08:07
Yeah, velocity.
Yep, alright. And then hit enter again and now you can paste in.
The copy that the the chron that we copied.

Manjunath S   1:08:23
And bring the next line.

James Maki   1:08:25
Yeah, yeah. Do one more line, hit enter.
Yep. And then, yeah. And then paste in our commands, paste it in right below. Yep, perfect. All right. And then we want to edit that. So the command that you created, it's not Northridge images, right? It was velocity. So you want to change that.
In the uh the make API.
If you wanna set that to the script that we just made.

Manjunath S   1:09:01
So then change the APN.
2.

James Maki   1:09:06
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we need to change that to the name of the script that you just created.

Manjunath S   1:09:08
Hello.
In the velocity.

James Maki   1:09:16
I think we just called it velocity, didn't we? Didn't we just say make AP?

Manjunath S   1:09:20
Yeah, Velocity.

James Maki   1:09:24
We definitely did not have images in the in the in the name.

Manjunath S   1:09:29
Or make under score API under score velocity right dot PHP.

James Maki   1:09:34
Right, yes.

Manjunath S   1:09:45
API under school.

James Maki   1:09:48
Yep, and and and capitalization matters. The name has to be exact. So we did. We did a lower case V, didn't we?
Because I I think we keep all of our, yeah, pretty much all this stuff is named as lowercase just because, OK.
All right, so yeah, so that is it. So you don't need to make any more changes, so you can escape to get out of your insert.

Manjunath S   1:10:23
Yes, I'm sorry.

James Maki   1:10:26
No, you're you're. Yes, there you go. All right. And we want to save these changes as well. So we're gonna do a colon WQ again.

Manjunath S   1:10:26
Please skip that. Uh, skip.
Yeah, colon QW.
Yeah.

James Maki   1:10:43
WQ that's I I'm not entirely sure. I've never tried to do it backwards. I don't know if it works.

Manjunath S   1:10:46
I'll see.

James Maki   1:10:53
Let's let's not try it here. Let's do a normal. Yeah, hit enter. Let's do that first. I am curious to know if that works, so I do kind of want to try that just for fun.

Manjunath S   1:11:01
Uh.

James Maki   1:11:07
Where can we try that at?
Do LL. I'll list out all those scripts again.
And uh, and I just wanna.
Wanna mess with one that I know is not in use? Let's do.
Let's do a Patelco the make API Patelco dot PHP.
Let's let's go into that real fast and I just wanna test the.

Manjunath S   1:11:49
It on James Mike.

James Maki   1:11:49
I want to test that Patelco make API Patelco. It's like the third one from the top.

Manjunath S   1:11:59
So.

James Maki   1:12:00
Yeah, that one. Yeah. Yeah, let's go into that real fast. Uh, so VI.
Yeah, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:12:12
And done.

James Maki   1:12:13
Yep.
And and so I'm using this one just because I know it's not in use right now. So let's go over, let's just do on the companies. Let's just change that from 21,000, just like take out like one of the digits, like one of the zeros or something.

Manjunath S   1:12:39
From the companies.

James Maki   1:12:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's like, take out the two.
I I just want to see what happens if if it'll let us. Let's do this.
OK, all right, so escape and then let's do do QW colon QW. I just want to see if that works.

Manjunath S   1:13:10
Yeah, and.

James Maki   1:13:11
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:13:18
No.

James Maki   1:13:19
Nope. OK. All right. That's my thought. OK.
All right, we can just exit then. Colon Q exclamation mark is is quit without saving, so let's just do that.
Uh, exclamation, not question.
There you go.
Cool. All right.
OK, so that was that was just for fun. All right, so we've got our disputes created. We have a schedule set up for them. Oh, and then I know I told you guys this the first time we went over dent disputes. Did you did you save?
That link to the the Quran guru.
Did uh, did you save that?
I'll send it to you again.
Um, so this is just a. This is just a handy tool for.

Manjunath S   1:14:15
Oh.

James Maki   1:14:27
Oh, cigar messaged me like cigar messaged me like almost 30 minutes ago now. Jeez.

Manjunath S   1:14:27
Sorry, James.

James Maki   1:14:32
Oh, that's oh, that's what he asked about. OK, he got his answer. OK, cool. I just sent you a link in the chat like save that like your favourites or like wherever you want to. But so this like Cron Guru is a is a great tool for understanding for understanding the.

Manjunath S   1:14:48
Yes Sir.

James Maki   1:14:52
In the in the chat, I sent you a link.

Manjunath S   1:14:59
Contact this one.

James Maki   1:14:59
Yeah, yeah, that one.
So this will help. This is a.
Yeah, this is just a great a great tool for for setting a cron schedule. So like if you're ever confused about like the formatting or like what like what is happening like this, this will tell you how to like what it is. So on the server if you do the cron tab dash L again.

Manjunath S   1:15:33
I stink. Should I copy this?

James Maki   1:15:34
No go go back to the server and do crontab dash L.

Manjunath S   1:15:50
Under.

James Maki   1:15:51
I.
Uh, you have the R in the wrong place. Cron tab.

Manjunath S   1:16:01
Oh.

James Maki   1:16:11
Yeah, that's it. Yep.
OK, all right. And so so this is just to help you guys understand like how the cron like how like the formatting of it is. So so like on the one that we just created the FIN V velocity. So if you copy those numbers in front.
Like the the 96 star star 1-5. So like if you copy that part and then paste it over into the cron guru, it'll tell you what the schedule is.

Manjunath S   1:16:45
OK.
So again, contrab.

James Maki   1:16:47
So so copy the schedule that we just set for fin V velocity.

Manjunath S   1:16:57
This one.

James Maki   1:16:58
Yeah, just the just the numbers, just the numbers in the beginning.

Manjunath S   1:17:01
OK.
By this day.

James Maki   1:17:06
To the 1-5, yes, right. So that is that is the schedule. So that is when the script is going to run. Yeah, so if you copy that and paste it over into Cron Guru.
It'll tell you exactly what the schedule is.

Manjunath S   1:17:23
Yeah.

James Maki   1:17:23
Yeah, yeah, so we overwrite all that the the 54 star, star overwrite that.
Uh, overwrite as in get rid of it. Like select the whole thing and just paste in what you copied.
Yeah, there you go. All right. So this is the schedule that we have set up. So at 6:09 on every day of the week from Monday through Friday, that's when the script is going to run. So, so this is the formatting of the schedule.
So you guys are going to need to know this. Whenever you're setting up new schedules, you need to know what the schedule is doing. So this is a great tool to help you remember and understand what the schedule is doing.

Manjunath S   1:18:04
OK.

James Maki   1:18:18
Does that make sense? Do you understand?

Manjunath S   1:18:23
One second, James. So this is like schedule for the company.

James Maki   1:18:29
Yes, this this is the schedule that we just set for the company.
So this is when the script is going to run. And the other thing and that's important to know is that the dev server is in GMT time like it's in like the zero time zone, right? So for us over here in the States.
Uh, for us, this schedule is.
What is it? We're in daylight savings now, so I think this is 5 hours ahead.
Of like of like my time zone. So whenever I'm setting a schedule, I have to keep that in mind, right?
So, so the schedule for this is 609 on every day a week from Monday through Friday, but it's 609 in GMT. So for me in central time zone, it's actually running at midnight 09 or one or 109, whatever the whatever the hourly difference is.

Manjunath S   1:19:12
Mhm.

James Maki   1:19:28
Right. So like, so just keep that in mind with the time zones.
So like whatever schedule you set, it's actually running like 5 to 6 hours before that, OK.

Manjunath S   1:19:41
Yeah.

James Maki   1:19:44
Yeah, OK, so it's just just something important. Yeah, just something important for you guys to remember, because for you it's gonna be.

Manjunath S   1:19:45
OK.

James Maki   1:19:52
Like you guys are gonna have to do a lot of calculations here, right? Because you have to keep these time zones in mind whenever you're setting the schedule. So like, it's not, it's not running. Yeah, like it's not running on your time. Well, actually it kind of is. It's kind of running closer to yours than it is ours, isn't it? But.

Manjunath S   1:19:58
OK, bye.
I.

James Maki   1:20:07
Anyway, so those are all just side notes just to try and explain that for you. So hopefully that made sense and I didn't say too much and confuse, confuse my message. But OK, but yeah, so yeah, so I would, I would just save the cron tab guru. I would just save that in your favorites.
Just whenever you're setting up a dev schedule, it's just a great tool to help you set it up the way that it needs to be, right? So just a just a great tool for you guys to have.

Manjunath S   1:20:43
No.

James Maki   1:20:44
Yeah, all right. So if you ever need to change this, so if you like, if you do need to change the cron jobs, the way you would do that is you would do the cron tab dash E and then you would go in and you can edit the numbers like say if they wanted to run at exactly the minute mark.
Like you would take out that nine and change it to a 0.

Manjunath S   1:21:07
OK, so even these are the the same numbers for the the post data.

James Maki   1:21:09
Right.
Yes, yeah, all of those are set up the same way.
Yeah, so you're like you would. So like if you wanted to check like Mariner for example, if you wanted to check that schedule, it's everything after the pound sign because that's the comment symbol. So for Mariner Finance, the schedule is from the 12 to the 1-5.
And so and so that really gets important when we're adding extra steps. So for this client, all we're doing is creating new disputes. So we're just putting stuff into the step one.
Other clients will have us also post data and so we are mimicking the Step 2 process for that. So that's a whole nother script.
That has to be edited for the company and then it has to be scheduled.
To run at whatever time they needed to run.
To accommodate whatever testing it is that they're doing.
So say like we're creating disputes in the morning, they want us to post data for it in the afternoon and then they want receipts generated at the end. All of those are different scripts that we would have to edit and then schedule.
In the proper order so that everything runs in the correct way, right? Because you want your step one, Step 2, and then step three to all run in order. So that's where the scheduling really gets important.
So we don't have to worry about it right now, but we can definitely dig into this or we will dig into this more over the course of the week.
And and yeah, and you guys will get a, you guys will get a lot more practice with this because we can kind of do whatever we want here in dev environment like we can use these companies that aren't actually using it, we can use them as our.

Manjunath S   1:22:57
Um.

James Maki   1:23:09
Like as our testing clients and you guys can come in, you can set up schedules, you can make disputes and you don't have to worry about interfering with any.
Any kind of like daily business or like live processes? Um.
So this is going to be great for just getting like a lot of ractice and that kind of thing.
All right, so for this one on the ticket. All right, so we've set up our disputes. We've we've set up the schedule.
Sigar has confirmed that the IPS are whitelisted, so we have done everything that they need for. Oh, actually, hold on, there is one more thing we need to do back in Sonnet. We need to give them an API token.
They are gonna need that.
O Let's go back over to Sonnet real fast.

Manjunath S   1:24:07
Sonet.

James Maki   1:24:08
OK, Yep, Yep, the sign it dev.

Manjunath S   1:24:11
Yeah.

James Maki   1:24:16
No, the dev that's on it.

Manjunath S   1:24:21
Oh, I'm deaf study.

James Maki   1:24:23
Yeah, that one. All right. We need to give them an API token. So if you go over to the admin side.

Manjunath S   1:24:24
Yes, James.

James Maki   1:24:38
Right. And you can just click on that green little the circle. It's almost like a refresh kind of a symbol for API token on the right side.

Manjunath S   1:24:51
And.

James Maki   1:24:53
Yeah, so that'll generate A token for them and they are. They are going to need that for their process. Oh, and the other thing I always forget this, I'm glad I remembered is the subscriber codes. They will not be able to pull the step one list.

Manjunath S   1:24:59
2.

James Maki   1:25:14
If you Scroll down just a little bit, you'll see the subscriber code section.
So as I said, this is old sonnet. So like a a new sonnet in production we have all those tabs right? Like IP addresses and additional settings like all all that stuff, all that stuff is separated. That was not the case previously. So here in old sonnet.

Manjunath S   1:25:30
Yeah.
Yeah.

James Maki   1:25:37
It's it's all on one screen. So you'll notice our subscriber codes there are currently blank. That is going to be a problem whenever they try to pull their step one list, so we need to add those.
So give me just a second here and I will tell you.
Which ones we need to add?

Manjunath S   1:26:00
Yes.

James Maki   1:26:04
And these are they are already added on some of the other companies that are currently using the dev environment.
Uh, so you could uh.
You could go over to one of those and copy the subscriber codes from there because they all use the same ones like all all the disputes that we generate.

Manjunath S   1:26:26
It will separate.

James Maki   1:26:29
Yeah, sorry, say it again.

Manjunath S   1:26:33
Oh, you said to copy the subscribe the code, right? So for that should I give an edit?

James Maki   1:26:40
Well, so you can you can copy them from a company that actually has them already. So you you would have to go find one. So off the top of my head, Mountain America is currently using the dev environment.
So if you go over to organizations and look up Mountain America.
Yeah, so if you click on them, they should have the subscriber codes that we need.

Manjunath S   1:27:09
Yeah.

James Maki   1:27:18
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you got, yes, you want to put all those into the new company. Honestly, this is something that ideally would be part of our scripts, but it's not unfortunately so.

Manjunath S   1:27:18
Oh, this one.
It.

James Maki   1:27:34
So we have to mainly add them. So what I would do is since there's multiple ones here that you have to copy instead of going back and forth if you if you scroll up to the organizations on the left side and right click and open in a new tab.
Yeah. All right. So that way you can put these up side by side. So you have Mountain America here. So on the new tab, if you go back over to the Velocity company.
Then you can kind of quickly.
Yeah, this will just make it easier for going back and forth and copying them. Yeah, so if you go down to that subscriber code section now and go to add or edit.

Manjunath S   1:28:24
And it.

James Maki   1:28:27
On the on the on the other one. On the velocity. Yeah, yeah, that one. Yeah, yeah. From here you have to edit to add the new ones. There you go. All right, so now you can quickly copy and paste from from Mountain America into this one.

Manjunath S   1:28:29
Henry.
So all this for anyone.

James Maki   1:28:47
Uh, all all of them.
You have to do it one at a time. You can't just copy the whole list one at one at a time.

Manjunath S   1:28:56
OK.
Understand.
OK, folks.

James Maki   1:29:05
Yep.

Manjunath S   1:29:07
The three games.

James Maki   1:29:09
Don't worry about those other three, you just have to have the code.

Manjunath S   1:29:12
It's at 12:00.

James Maki   1:29:14
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:29:29
Again, you give fax 3.

James Maki   1:29:32
Uh, Yep.

Manjunath S   1:29:43
Speak.

James Maki   1:30:11
There you go. All right, so that's necessary for them to pull to step one list. Like I said, if the subscriber codes are not entered, they will get an error message. And I have done that so many times where I've forgotten to add these and then and then, yeah, and then implementation gets mad at me, so.

Manjunath S   1:30:25
OK.

James Maki   1:30:29
So please make a note to add those in the dev environment. Whenever you're setting up a company, it'll it'll save you a little bit of time in the long run. I promise. OK, so codes are there. Disputes are in step one queue. Schedule is set up.
I think we are finally ready for the user creation.
And then and then they should be good to go.

Manjunath S   1:31:05
So that's it.
So that's it.

James Maki   1:31:09
Yeah, for this one that should be it. After you after you create the users, that should be the last thing.
Yeah, so you can do a back. There's a there's there's a there's a back to company option right below the editing subscriber codes.

Manjunath S   1:31:25
Yeah.

James Maki   1:31:25
Yeah, there we go.
Right. And so you do wanna on the ticket when you respond after you set up the users, you do wanna send her the API token from there also, because they're gonna need that to pull the step one list, of course. And yeah, and you can tell her.

Manjunath S   1:31:38
OK.
So I think.
Hmm.

James Maki   1:31:46
Go ahead. What were you going to ask?

Manjunath S   1:31:47
Yeah, I was just what was the. I can create the users in this or not only right or should be creating dev task only.

James Maki   1:32:00
Only in dev. Yeah. So from here you can go to view users and then you can add them from there. Yeah. Oh, and actually before you do that, add the IP addresses because whenever you're setting up the user, it's gonna ask you for that IP address.

Manjunath S   1:32:04
OK.
Sure.

James Maki   1:32:16
So if you don't have that injured, then yeah, then that'll be a little bit more of a pain also. So this is a little bit different like I said there. So there is no IP address section on the company page here in dev, just just another thing that that's another thing that was added.

Manjunath S   1:32:18
Mhm.
Mhm.

James Maki   1:32:34
Whenever we did our last upgrade, so there but there is an IP addresses section on the left is where you want to go.

Manjunath S   1:32:49
IP address.

James Maki   1:32:50
Yep.
Alright, and then to add new ones, it's gonna be down at the bottom.
Yeah, all right. And so they sent us for Sonnet access. I believe they only sent us two IP addresses on the ticket, right? It's those the workstation ones. It's just those two should be the actual user IP addresses.

Manjunath S   1:33:25
Yeah, this winter.

James Maki   1:33:27
Uh.
Yes, yes, correct. There's two there though, so you have to do them one at a time.
So like the first, the the first one. Yeah, first one ends at the 103, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:33:40
Yeah.
Description New IP.

James Maki   1:33:58
Yep, I I just put the company name. Usually I I just say either either Fenvi or Velocity, one of the two. Yeah, that's fine. And then and then you have to select the company so it it it defaults to Palinode.

Manjunath S   1:34:03
OK.
Can we?

James Maki   1:34:13
But we're not setting this up for us. We're setting it up for them. So if you start typing the name, yeah, it should come up again.
There are a bunch of like FIS. So yeah, so it there. That one. Yeah, there you go. All right. And add IP address. Yep.

Manjunath S   1:34:29
Yeah, got it.
I need the address.
I mean another one also, right?

James Maki   1:34:38
Right. And then it's gonna take. Yeah. And then copy the other one. Yeah. And it's whenever you add it, it does take you back up to the top. It's kind of annoying. This is This is why we changed it in the the new version I saw it. This is why all this stuff is gone is because this was not very.
Intuitive.

Manjunath S   1:35:00
And I see.

James Maki   1:35:01
There you go. Yeah. And then and then now that you've added them in first, now when you're setting up the users, those will come up as options for the list. So that way you don't have to like set them up. Well, actually, because I think the IP address is required, I don't think it'll let you set up the user without it.
Uh.

Manjunath S   1:35:18
So should I add all this IP addresses?

James Maki   1:35:22
No, you don't need the other ones. You just need those workstation ones. Those are going to be like the actual users. Everything else is going to be server related. So yeah, so like cigar, I believe he sent all of those to the Cato team already.

Manjunath S   1:35:28
Oh.

James Maki   1:35:38
So that should so this should all be good to go.

Manjunath S   1:35:38
Mhm.
OK.

James Maki   1:35:43
And yeah, yeah, so after you have those users, that should be it. Like I said, just send the API token. Make sure you include that on the ticket when you respond because they are gonna need that.
I.

Manjunath S   1:35:59
So this is the first name and this is the last name right James?

James Maki   1:36:05
Yes, correct. Yeah, it's yeah, first name dot last name looks like there.
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:36:25
So should I?

James Maki   1:36:27
Yep, yes.

Manjunath S   1:36:30
And yourself.

James Maki   1:36:32
Yep.

Manjunath S   1:36:35
OK, so adding all this also for the responses like the company has been created and the API token is this that's it right?

James Maki   1:36:45
Yep, yeah, yeah. And and that should should take care of that.

Manjunath S   1:41:27
This was created successfully.

James Maki   1:41:38
Yeah, that's the last one.

Manjunath S   1:41:41
Yeah.

James Maki   1:41:42
OK, excellent. All right. Yeah. So I think.
OK. Oh, yeah. So let's respond to Amanda. Go ahead. You can take the ticket from me since you did all the work here.
And let's do kind of, yeah, let's just do our normal stuff here. So yeah, task put it at, put it at a high priority since they escalated it. Let's say it was a high priority. Affinity. Yep.

Manjunath S   1:42:07
Yeah.
Hello.
Me.

James Maki   1:42:19
And there's a there's a category for dev.
Yeah, there's a there's a dev category, so I would just use that.
Uh, Yep. Yeah, 700 support.
Support. No, because because we did all this ourselves. All right, so we can tell her company, company and users have been set up. Disputes of being, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:42:38
OK.
Tom and.
So.

James Maki   1:42:49
Yeah, this, yeah, this is just going to Amanda, so.

Manjunath S   1:42:59
Who's this?

James Maki   1:43:03
Yep, Yep. And then disputes have also been created.

Manjunath S   1:43:05
So.
Disputes.

James Maki   1:43:14
And Yep, yeah, disputes have also been created and a schedule.
Oh.
Yeah, and scheduled to generate daily.
Yep. And then and then just here is the API. Yep, here's the API token and let us know if there's anything else.

Manjunath S   1:43:35
OK.
Sorry, excuse.

James Maki   1:43:48
Bless you.

Manjunath S   1:43:53
Yeah.

James Maki   1:43:54
All right. And that's it. So as of right now, that's all we have to do. So unless, unless they come back and say.

Manjunath S   1:43:58
I have to copy the.

James Maki   1:44:07
Uh, the API token? Oh yes, yeah, you do need that.
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I added.

Manjunath S   1:44:16
Thank you.

James Maki   1:44:20
Oh, does it not let you?

Manjunath S   1:44:21
No.

James Maki   1:44:22
Oh, boy. OK, that's interesting. All right, wait, hold on. Really.
So do that to me too.
Oh oh, you can still double click on it and it'll still highlight.
There you go. Yeah. Yeah. So you can still copy it. Yeah, I think that's just saying it won't let you edit. I think that's what that that's what that read.
Some of those were.

Manjunath S   1:44:52
Also that let us say that IP address has been also a cluster or is it?

James Maki   1:44:57
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can add that too. Sure.
I I do like to list out like everything that was done just for record keeping and just in case anyone else has to go back and look for whatever reason. I I do think it's better to list out as much stuff as possible like all the work that you did.
Yeah, and that should be good. Yeah, let us know if there's anything else.

Manjunath S   1:45:25
Yeah.

James Maki   1:45:26
Alright, and then since this is a dev ticket and it's just going to Amanda.
Oh, would I even put this in pin in?
Yeah, let's put it in pending for right now, just to.
Just to make sure they don't have to reopen it.

Manjunath S   1:45:54
Pending.

James Maki   1:45:56
Yeah, yeah, let's do pending just to be safe.
And then, uh, I think there was a did we already merge it?
I think there was a second ticket. I can't remember if me and Sigar. OK, we already merged it. OK, cool. We're good. All right. Yeah, that's it for that one. All right, so we are waiting for or we are needing the the public IP address. So Sunbit is the next dev company.
It's a ticket 22892.

Manjunath S   1:46:33
Oh Jim, so Sagaras put a text in the group. This is like adjoint.

James Maki   1:46:40
OK. All right. Well, we'll look at that here in just a second. All right. I'm just a I'm a sign in.
Assigning this other ticket over to you for a Sunday.
And so, all right. And so you guys can work on Sunbit here. Let's take it 22892. I'll let you guys work on that on your own and you're basically, it's basically all the same stuff.
Um.

Manjunath S   1:47:10
In the company. Oh yeah, for the your company name.

James Maki   1:47:19
Uh, Sunbit is the company.
And yeah, so, yeah, so Sagar is getting their public IP address. Yeah, yeah. So it's gonna follow the same steps. So I'm, I'm gonna let you guys work on that without me and just let me know when you guys are. Yeah, let me know when you guys are done and we can kind of.

Manjunath S   1:47:29
OK.
Sure, sure.

James Maki   1:47:43
Go back and double check everything, but OK, all right, so that's it for the dev stuff. All right, let's look at what was the what was the ticket that you had.

Manjunath S   1:47:52
This is like they are not received a step on step three.

James Maki   1:47:58
OK.
All right, so they're not getting their step files. All right, so where do you think we should check first?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:48:14
ohh James I have checked that so for 19th and 20 we don't have step two from their end.

Manjunath S   1:48:14
Second, this is.

James Maki   1:48:25
OK, alright. Well, so, so they're saying.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:48:30
From 18th we don't they don't have.

James Maki   1:48:34
Huh. OK.
The PDQ OK and files were actually generated, right? We did have step one files on those days.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:48:47
Yes.

James Maki   1:48:48
OK.
Wait, hold on. What is she saying here? It's the 18th.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:48:56
On 18th.

James Maki   1:48:59
But that's not true.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:48:59
She has step one but not Step 3.

James Maki   1:49:01
Oh.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:49:06
But on 18th she got all those steps.

James Maki   1:49:06
OK.
OK.
All right.
Alright, so they're saying they're not getting their files. Alright, so alright, so where do you guys think we should check first? Where do we need to look to start?
Investigating this.
Uh, right.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:49:29
The admin site.

James Maki   1:49:30
Let's see. OK, yes, alright. So you checked on there.
Uh, who's uh, Major? Are you still in control?
Did did you time out Moju? You still there?

Manjunath S   1:49:55
Sorry, James, I was on mute. I was talking about. Oh, sorry, not PDQ services.

James Maki   1:49:58
OK, OK. OK.
Alright, no worries.
Yeah.

Manjunath S   1:50:13
Let's see.

James Maki   1:50:15
Hmm.

Manjunath S   1:50:18
Which date on 18th?
Open step two, step three.

James Maki   1:50:29
OK.
All right, so the 18th looks normal. Step 1-2 and three are all there.
And she's saying that they did not receive their step three file.
All right. And then that's when everything broke. So they're saying they did not receive the step three file on the 18th, and then they haven't received any any of the other files since then. All right, so the first question is, do we still have those files?

Manjunath S   1:51:03
The FTP server I think no gems even now you also check this.

James Maki   1:51:03
Yeah.
OK.
All right, so yeah, so we can either we can either go over to the server directly or here in the UI. If you go to the company data files tab, that will show us all the pending files, right? So if they're if they are still on the server, we'll see them there.
And if not, it should be nothing.

Manjunath S   1:51:33
Additional settings.

James Maki   1:51:34
Yeah, no, we're gonna look at the the data files tab. So we've got a visit inside it, yeah.

Manjunath S   1:51:38
The different system.
Yeah.

James Maki   1:51:44
There we go. All right, all right. And so there's nothing in the files waiting. All right, so the files are not on our server, so it looks like they are being uploaded at least.
Uh so.
So what do you think we should check next? It it looks like the files are uploading for us. What else can we do to try and verify?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:52:15
In FTP server.

Manjunath S   1:52:15
Sorry, James.

James Maki   1:52:19
Uh, Yep, that's where I would look next.
So if we go over to the web 01 server.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:02
In FTP, we do have those files.

James Maki   1:53:08
Oh, we do have the files.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:10
Yes.

James Maki   1:53:11
And for PDQ.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:15
Yes.

Manjunath S   1:53:22
Um.
PDQ services.

James Maki   1:53:36
Where where are you seeing the files at Supriya?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:41
Oh, I have moved it, James.

James Maki   1:53:44
Oh, you moved it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:47
Yes.
But.

James Maki   1:53:49
Where'd you move it to?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:53:57
Inters on it.

James Maki   1:54:04
Uh, what do you mean? What do you mean into Sonnet?
Do you? Do you? Do you want? Yeah, I was gonna say you wanna share your screen so we can see.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:54:10
We shared mostly.
Oh, these were the files we were having before.
And have moved some of those.

James Maki   1:54:30
Oh, OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:54:32
But here I don't see this like we will get right next step to.

James Maki   1:54:34
Alright.
I.
Yeah, well, you just moved them. You moved them out of the folder. Yeah, you just took them out of the the company folder.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:54:44
OK.
Yes.

James Maki   1:54:49
So yeah, so you don't want to do that. Like, what's? What's the point of that? What?
We we need them if they if they need to be uploaded to the company, then they still need to be in the company folder.
So you don't wanna move those out to the sonnet directory or to the the FTP. So you put them into FTP dir.
Peter.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:55:11
Mhm.

James Maki   1:55:11
If if you moved them U.
Oh, and there's other files there. Have you done this before? Is that where these ones from May 17th?
So if you so if you go up a level up to the FTP dir.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:55:40
Uh, Lord James.

James Maki   1:55:42
All right, so you need to go up a level, go go to where you moved the files.

Manjunath S   1:55:48
3D space.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:55:52
OK.

Manjunath S   1:55:52
dot dot.

James Maki   1:55:55
All right, so if you list these out.
No, we've already been there. List out the contents.

Manjunath S   1:56:11
They love, they love to play.

James Maki   1:56:12
Yeah.
All right, and it's and they're at the top. So if you scroll up, you're gonna see some CSV files there.
All right, so all right, so like, do you see the problem here?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:56:26
Oh.

James Maki   1:56:31
So there's all these files here. Where did they come from?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:56:33
So the before if we move that it won't go to Sonic directly since before we have did the same procedure right? So I talked to do this.

James Maki   1:56:48
No, we there's there's there's really no reason to ever do this. So all right, so all all of those student files, all of those are the PDQ ones, every everything from the 18th. OK, it should be because they said that they're missing the step 3 from the 18th and they didn't get anything out for that, OK.
All right, let's move these back like they they do need to be in the company folder. You you don't want to put stuff into the root FTP dir.
Yeah, like we don't, we don't really do anything from there, so we need to move these back.
O Let's do MV.
And reduce space 20/25/06.
And star.
All right. And then space and we're gonna do period forward slash PDQ services.
Yep. All right, so we're moving all the files that are in the FTP dir. We're moving all of these that have the date 2025 of 06. So everything for the month of June, because those are the only files that are there.
So we're we're moving those back to the PDQ services folder, so hit enter.
All right, and now let's go back to the PDQ directory and we should see those files there.
OK, perfect. OK, so whenever we're sending files to a client, we want to do it from their company folder. You really you really shouldn't be doing anything from the FTP der folder unless you're setting up a new company or removing one.
That's that's really all we kind of do there, right? So yeah, so you don't, you don't really ever want to move files back to that root because there's nothing here to identify it, right? So like, because there was a couple other files there that we saw from May, who and where? Where did those files come from?
Right. Like we have to, we'd have to investigate and go into the file and look them up and find out where this came from because they're a month old now. So don't. So don't do that. OK, so all right, so they're not getting their files.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:59:16
OK.

James Maki   1:59:21
So they are hosting the FTP. That's why there's the the get dot FTP and the put dot FTP commands. All that stuff is there because they're hosting. So the next thing I would do is test the FTP connection.
O We need to get their credentials.
Out of VS code for VS Studio.
Alright, and they are going to be in the data files repo, so we're going to change to that. So if you go to file.
And we're going to open folder.
And we're gonna select data files.
Select folder.
Right. All right. And so if you drop down that commands, if you drop that down so we can see the list.
Just like the the arrow next to it. It's already highlighted commands.
At the top.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:00:51
Mhm.

James Maki   2:00:52
Down the highlighted one. There you go. There we go. All right, so here's all of our data files commands for all of our companies, right? So this is where we're going to get our FTP credentials from. So you can find PDQ in this list.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:00:54
Yes.
Mhm.

James Maki   2:01:19
Yep, yeah, in any of them. Yeah, it doesn't matter which one. Any of the PDQ ones, they they all have their credentials saved in them, so it doesn't matter which one you select.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:01:20
Yes.

James Maki   2:01:29
All right, and so if you Scroll down just a little bit here inside of the scripts, there are our SFTP commands. So the first thing we've talked about it before, but just as a reminder.
In the password, watch out for escape characters. That's going to be those two backslashes there. So those are necessary to allow the dollar sign to be passed through in the password. So when we test this, we actually do not need those.
That's just for the automation command, so you can take out those two backslashes inside inside of the password. So it's that FTP force on it in in between the dollar signs.
See it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:02:23
This month.

James Maki   2:02:24
Uh, Nope.
It's gonna be that the orange. Look at the look at the orange.
Yeah, right there. Yeah. So you want to take out those two backslashes because those are not actually part of the password. They're they're just escape characters.
Yep, right there. And then the one in front.
Great. OK, all right, so now we have the password in the correct format. So now we can actually test the credentials. So copy the SFTP through the IP address.
Right after the password SFTP and then it's username and password you want SFTP.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:03:14
2.

James Maki   2:03:18
All the way, all the way to the IP address. Include the SFTP.
Yeah, exactly. There you go. Perfect. All right, copy that. So that's our SFTSFTP command is what that is, right? So that's what we're gonna use on the server to connect to their server.
So go back over to Web 01 and you can paste that in.
Yep.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:03:57
OK.

James Maki   2:03:59
Alright, and then I generally I like to copy the password first, just so I have it ready.
So you can you can either hit enter or we can go back and copy the password now either one.
All right, it's taking a minute. It's not a good sign.
OK, all right, so we are getting blocked.
All right, so let's let's copy that error message there.
And we're gonna send that to them.
Yeah, I would copy the the key key exchange identification. I would copy that too, yeah.
All right, there you go. All right. And and on the ticket, let's respond. So we need to tell them that we are having trouble connecting to their server.
Yeah, this is the error message that we're getting.
Yeah, and and let's ask her to check with her IT team.
If there are any issues.
So whenever we get blocked like that and there's not like A and there's not like an authentication error message or like, like you're getting blocked before it even asks you for the password, right? So it's not a login issue because you're not even getting that far, so.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:06:02
Stop.

James Maki   2:06:12
It definitely seems to be something changed on their side that's not blocking us and.
Yeah, so that's good. So we need them to check and tell us.
Yeah, you can do step file. Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, that's good.
All right, display it in pending and hopefully they come back and say that they fixed it and we can try again.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:06:39
If.

James Maki   2:06:40
Excellent.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:06:43
This one I think.

James Maki   2:06:45
Yes, that is the one we had. Yeah, we had that phone call with him on Friday and I was supposed to follow up with the dev team and I forgot.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:06:46
On Friday we have.
Yeah.

James Maki   2:06:58
So let me send them a message right now since I said I was going to.
And this is for the receipt files, is that right?
And what do their files look like currently?

Manjunath S   2:07:55
Again, so 22887. Now can I close the ticket?

James Maki   2:08:05
Give me just one second here. Let me finish this message to the devs and I need to get clarification on this.

Manjunath S   2:08:09
Or.

James Maki   2:08:52
Yeah.
All right, all right. So I'm getting getting clarification on that one before you respond, Sabria.
And just to make sure that we're not, yeah, just just make sure that we're not going back to the full account numbers. And yeah, we'll we'll just kind of have to deal with that.
Alright, so we'll wait and wait until they respond. Alright, what was the ticket you sent, Maju?
Uh, for Hughes.
Oh, OK, yeah.
Oh.
Yes, yeah, that was. So, yeah, that was when the the account masking was not working. All right. And that's tied to a problem ticket, right?

Manjunath S   2:09:41
Yeah.

James Maki   2:09:42
Let's actually.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and tell them.
Tell them on that. On that use ticket. Tell them that this. Oh yeah, Sherry said. Yeah, she said she can see the whole numbers now. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, absolutely close that.

Manjunath S   2:10:15
Oh, can't.

James Maki   2:10:15
Yeah, definitely. And then and then there's probably a couple other tickets tied to the problem ones. Looks like a few of those are already solved. A couple are still open and so I think we might be able to.
OK, it looks like Sigar already updated some of these. OK, perfect.
Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So that one from Hughes. You can go ahead and close out.
And then hopefully by the end of the day, hopefully we can close out this problem ticket 'cause there's a few more that are still in pending that Skari asked him to confirm that's working.
So depending on what responses we get there, we can probably close that out.

Manjunath S   2:10:56
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:11:01
Oh, James.
I think these two are the same one, right?
So here she is asking there are 254 files not downloaded.
And this one.

James Maki   2:11:31
OK.
OK, alright, yeah, so this ticket was for the white listing and then she has a second one for the.
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:11:50
Hmm.

James Maki   2:11:52
Let's see.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:11:53
So this is respond and she have raised a new ticket. So I think those two are the same request, right?

James Maki   2:11:54
OK. OK. Yeah.
Right.
It looks like it, yeah. Yeah. And so you already said, yeah, you said that we'll follow up.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:12:05
Yeah.
Yes, but she's telling this is a different action.

James Maki   2:12:11
Yeah.
I don't know what she means by that. I mean, this ticket was for a different action, yes, because it was for a sign in issue, which is resolved, and now there's a new ticket for the data issue, which is what we're gonna follow up on.
Yeah, I would still go ahead and solve that. Yeah, go ahead and solve this one. You've already told her what you're doing, so I don't think you need to send another message. Solve this one. And then, yeah, and then we'll focus on the on the 959.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:12:36
Yes, so that's.

James Maki   2:12:51
We'll uh, yeah, we'll respond to the data issue on this one.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:12:51
It.

James Maki   2:12:57
Because, yeah, you're you're right. I I I don't know what she was trying to say with that.
Yeah, that didn't really make sense.
Yeah, so let's work.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:13:12
Sport.

James Maki   2:13:12
Yeah, let's work on this one. All right, so let's see what's going on.
All right, so 254 in the step one queue. All right.
Alright, do these guys use step files? I believe they do, right? We've looked at these guys a few times.
All right. And so there is no Step 2 there.
Oh, but there are a couple step to file. Oh, if you Scroll down just a little bit.
And that file's waiting. There's two files there, right?
So we should have the files that we need. So my next thought is.
What's? What's blocking these from loading? So the files are on the server, but they're not loading for some reason.
O Let's go look on the server.
OK, alright. So that's kind of exactly what I was expecting. So we talked about this a little bit last week. This looks like the same issue that CCS is having, right? Like where their step 2 files are getting hung and so there's that dot locked file is there.
And it's from. It's been there since the 19th, so it's blocking all the other files from processing because it's essentially hung. So what we need to do is we need to remove that dot locked file.
dot CD You're you're already in dot CD. You're not changing directories.
There you go.
Yeah, Yep, run that.
All right, so that'll take care of the lock. So now we can process those files. So now back over in Sonnet. Now you can just click that button to read the step two file and those should load in now.
Yeah, and you only have to hit it once. Yeah, it'll load. It'll load both the files, so it'll take care of everything after that. So now you're just waiting for those to load. So that should only take a few minutes.
Because then after the files load, then they have to run through the rules engine also, right? So it's going to take a few minutes for that to process and get done. But then when that is when that is done, just double check and make sure that there's no more disputes.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:16:14
Yeah.
OK.

James Maki   2:16:24
Waiting for data and as long as that number goes down to zero, you can respond and say that the step 2 files have been processed.
And they should be good to go.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:16:36
OK.
Oh, this one I have asked to Amanda.

James Maki   2:16:49
OK.
It was.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:16:53
So just looking into this.

James Maki   2:16:59
Oh, what's this one? Oh, this is the account history one. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jeez, that looks ugly. What's going on here?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:17:18
So this one.

James Maki   2:17:19
Oh, so it looks like they're. Yeah, so it looks like they just want a root cause.
Yes.
All right, yeah, that's definitely one that we need to follow up with Amanda on, because I have absolutely no idea what she was doing to resolve this. But yeah, so if if you've already messaged, yeah, if you've already messaged Amanda about her, then yeah, that's really all you can do for the moment.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:17:39
Uh.

James Maki   2:17:44
Yeah, and and if you don't get a response, you just keep trying to escalate with her. I know she's she's pretty busy, so like, I don't think she's ignoring you intentionally or anything.
Um, she just has a lot of stuff going on, but yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:18:02
Yeah, I understand. Um, yes.
OK, we'll ask her later. I will remind her.

James Maki   2:18:14
OK, sounds good.

Saravanabhavan S   2:18:16
James James 22953.

James Maki   2:18:18
Yes.
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   2:18:24
I just, uh, reset the password and sent to him, but he's telling I didn't receive the receive the tone.

James Maki   2:18:25
OK.
OK, oh, he's oh.
Oh, he.
That looks like that's a Pravana e-mail, I don't think.
Uh, that's not Sonnet.
It doesn't look like.
Um, I think he needs.
All right, so this is Russ. So he was. I can't remember what his official title was, but he was, he was basically like our contract manager.
Was like one of the big things that he did for Palinode, or I guess still does for Palinode.
But yeah, all right. But so he looks that screenshot that he sent, right? Like that's coming from Pravana AADFS. It looks like that's for his outlook for his e-mail. So that's not a password that we can reset.

Saravanabhavan S   2:19:33
Is.

James Maki   2:19:41
So he needs to talk to the IT looks like he needs to talk to the Pravana IT team.

Saravanabhavan S   2:19:48
OK.

James Maki   2:19:49
Um.
I'm honestly not sure how.
So the only contact I have with those guys is in teams, right? Like we're in the IT help group. That's the only way that I know how to get ahold of those guys.
I don't know if I don't know if Russ can enter an SSD ticket. I think that's what he really needs.

Saravanabhavan S   2:20:22
So what's it? I tell him that we can contact the IT team on SSC ticket.

James Maki   2:20:29
I yeah, yeah. Ask him if he's able to access the SSD system.

Saravanabhavan S   2:20:35
OK.

James Maki   2:20:36
Because, yeah, I think he, yeah, he needs to. Or I wonder if he needs us to do to do that for him too. Yeah, this honestly just has nothing to do with us.
Is there do you guys know? Is there like an IT e-mail address? Can what if we can you CC them on the ticket? Is there like an IT at pravana.com or something? Do you guys know?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:21:07
need to check gyms. IT we will be having but not sure which one that is.

James Maki   2:21:14
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:21:16
We last several.

James Maki   2:21:19
OK. All right. Sounds good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:21:24
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   2:21:25
James 22952.

James Maki   2:21:36
OK, these are for the control number errors. OK, all right, so we do. We already have a dev task for that, but I know that these people disputes won't wait for that, right? Disputes have a due date. They can't wait for two weeks.
Yes.
Oh God, what is happening here?
All right, I just stumbled across something else. OK, so we can fix those and we definitely need to fix the ones that are coming up soon. I fixed some at the end of last week that we're going to.
Expire over the weekends.
Um, but OK.
Uh.
OK, scroll up.
Or is is this a different?

Saravanabhavan S   2:22:39
This way.

James Maki   2:22:51
OK.
Alright, so they gave us the control numbers and what we really need are gonna be the dispute IDs.
So let's go ahead, copy that first control number.
Just, just, just the first one. Well, we have, we have to do these. Yeah, we have to do these one at a time. Yeah. So we need to look up the Sonnet IDs first. So yeah, so copy that and then let's go over to Sonnet and on the admin side.

Saravanabhavan S   2:23:13
OK.
Plus.

James Maki   2:23:28
I will use the the dispute search.
Yeah, you just, uh, just go to admin.
Yeah, just go to admin from right here. Like it's right there on the right. Sign in admin.
No, just go, just go to Sonnet admin.
Yeah, right there. There you go. OK, yeah. So let's look these up on on this side. So on the left side under admin, there's like the the dispute section.
And we can do a search from there.
There you go.
Yeah, so we're gonna do a search and we do have to, we have to use PG admin to fix these. But yeah, yeah, go ahead, paste in the control number, do a search and that'll give us the the sonnet ID.
Alright, uh, go ahead and copy that ID.
Because we're going to need it later.

Saravanabhavan S   2:24:50
So like I think company name is a different.

James Maki   2:24:55
No, it's the same. So Selfbank is like the is like the parent is like the parent company and lead bank is like their main is like their main branch is all is all that is. Yeah, so you're looking at the right one. So copy that's on it ID.

Saravanabhavan S   2:24:57
Yeah.
Put.
OK.
OK.

James Maki   2:25:12
And over in PG admin.
Yeah, we're gonna run a query. So we've talked about this a few times over the last couple weeks.
Yeah, so what's happening is we're seeing duplicates in the E Oscar response table. So if you do a select.
Let's, yeah, select. Let's do ID comma dispute under score ID.
Yep, right.
Uh, you don't need the second comma. That's that's that's enough.
Take out that comma and reduce space from E Oscar under score response.
E Oscars altogether. There's no no under score between it.
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   2:26:20
Yeah.

James Maki   2:26:21
OK, where dispute dispute under score ID equals and then paste in the ID that you copied.

Saravanabhavan S   2:26:31
Dispute.

James Maki   2:26:32
Yep, under score ID.
Yeah, and then.

Saravanabhavan S   2:26:40
So I have to give the control number or a dispute ID.

James Maki   2:26:44
We're we're doing the dispute ID. So the the control number I don't think exists on the E Oscar response table like that's not it's not logged there. So we can't use that we we need. That's why we looked it up in the admin side first is because we need the dispute ID in order to do this.
Uh, so that's that's why we did it. Uh, so you so you can paste in the ID that you copied.

Saravanabhavan S   2:27:08
So the same control number that.

James Maki   2:27:11
No, paste it. We copied the ID, right? We we just copied the ID. Yes, there you go. You got it. All right, so now you can run. You can run that.

Saravanabhavan S   2:27:12
That song.
OK, OK, sounded.

James Maki   2:27:22
And we're gonna see two entries here. Oh, we lost your connection. Oh, you gotta refresh your PG admin.
Copy before you close it. Before you close it, copy this, copy this query and let's just let's just like paste it onto the ticket so that way you don't lose it and we can just get it right back.

Saravanabhavan S   2:27:45
So where I have to Google gemstone?

James Maki   2:27:47
Just paste it on the ticket for right now, just just so we can keep it.
Yeah.
Yeah, or or in your word. Yeah. Or you can put it in a word. Yeah, either one. Yeah, there you go. All right. And yeah, because you're gonna have to recopy your like your token, right, to get back onto the PG admin. So yeah, all right, so.

Saravanabhavan S   2:27:58
I will.
The 10th.

James Maki   2:28:16
Uh, I think if you click.
So right now you're in the query tool like on the on the left side of your PG admin like highlighted is the query tool. Right above that is the yeah the default workspace. Click on that up above above.
And one more, one more.
Yep. All right, so if you click the button to open up a new query tool.
And this should prompt you for the token.
In a in a second after it gets.
There we go. Alright, yeah, and now in your command prompts, you can just run the.

Saravanabhavan S   2:29:14
So I run.

James Maki   2:29:15
You shouldn't have. You can click out of it like so if you go over to your command prompts you have to get a new token.
Yeah, and I don't. I don't think the token changes. I think you could just copy and paste this again and let's see if that works.
Yeah.
All right, so let's see if that'll. Yeah, and hit OK.
Excellent. OK, OK, yeah, yeah. Copy the query over over here.

Saravanabhavan S   2:29:45
So shall I?

James Maki   2:29:51
And this time it should work.
Oh, no, I guess not.
Uh, did your uh did your PIM access expire?

Saravanabhavan S   2:30:03
No names I just.

James Maki   2:30:08
I bet it expired. So if you go back over to the the web portal like where you where you you have to sign into your groups, right? You have to activate them.

Saravanabhavan S   2:30:18
So shall I do it again or I can do this key?

James Maki   2:30:21
Uh, I think it expired.

Saravanabhavan S   2:30:25
OK.

James Maki   2:30:25
So let's let's let's check your PIM access. Like let's go to the PIM screen.
And we need we need to check your active groups or roles, I think is what it is.

Saravanabhavan S   2:30:36
I was like I can generate the new one.

James Maki   2:30:39
I mean you you can generate a new one if your PIM access is still active. So we need to verify that first. We need to make sure that your PIM.

Saravanabhavan S   2:30:50
OK, so.
OK, so how to verify that one?

James Maki   2:30:56
Alright, so where do you go to activate your groups?
But before you get your token, there's something else you have to do, right?

Saravanabhavan S   2:31:08
Yes, we have to do in Azure.

James Maki   2:31:11
Oh yeah, so you already have the tab up. You have the my roles. It's your second tab.
You already have it up.
OK, if you want to open up a new one, that's fine.

Saravanabhavan S   2:31:41
Active only.

James Maki   2:31:42
OK, alright, so it is still active. OK, so yes, so just run the command to get a new token then.
Yeah, yeah. So if you just hit up on your keyboard there, it should take you to the.
You need you need to generate a new one. It looks like that one expired, so if you just hit up to run the command again.

Saravanabhavan S   2:32:03
OK.

James Maki   2:32:29
Yeah.
All right, there we go. Now I think we're good.
There we go. It's now we run this. We should get 2.
Results here.
Or at least two. I have actually seen it before where there was 3.
Wow, that's taking a while. This is not a hard query.
There we go. OK, all right, so this dulication, this is what's causing that error. So what we need to do is we actually do need to delete one of these.

Saravanabhavan S   2:34:34
Yeah.

James Maki   2:34:34
So I always do the one with the higher number, so like this one ends in 902 and then 903. I always delete the second one, so I I would do the 903. Yeah, so copy that and then and then below your first query.
Uh, start start a new line.
And we're gonna do a second query this time to delete from E Oscar response.
Don't forget the under score.

Saravanabhavan S   2:35:17
Uh, where I I can give ID.

James Maki   2:35:22
Oh, just yes, where ID equals.
And then paste in.
Yeah, and then you can paste in that ID. OK, all right. Not yet. So you have a couple of mistakes here. Well, there's one. Your your table name. You're missing something. E Oscar response. You're missing something.
I can compare that to the line above. What's different?
Yep.
OK, uh uh.

Saravanabhavan S   2:36:13
Will I run the query now?

James Maki   2:36:19
So are you? Yeah, you can try.
You're you're gonna have a problem here, but go ahead.

Saravanabhavan S   2:36:32
OK.

James Maki   2:36:47
Yeah, all right. So the problem here is that you have two different queries, so you can't run 2 queries simultaneously, so you have to highlight just the second line.
Because we're just running the delete statement.
Yeah, now you can run it.
And so this will just run the delete query.
And that's what you're trying to do.

Saravanabhavan S   2:37:18
Because I can date the first first line and run it, it takes almost longer.

James Maki   2:37:23
Yeah, well, it's not done yet. Yeah, it's still running, so I would wait for that to finish before you start editing stuff. But and then so after this is done though, so then the the response can be submitted.

Saravanabhavan S   2:37:41
OK.

James Maki   2:37:41
And so so you so you can either. You can either do that for them, which is what I generally do, but you don't have to.
But generally over in Sonnet, I would go into their air recue, I would find that dispute the the ID that you had there and I would just submit it for them just to get it done. But you don't have to you you can you can make them responsible for that part and that's totally fine.
So, all right, so we fixed the first one. So there's a couple more IDs that they sent us there, right? Or control numbers. So now we need to do the next one.

Saravanabhavan S   2:38:31
I just, uh, change.

James Maki   2:38:33
Not, not here. We're we're not using the control.

Saravanabhavan S   2:38:34
Controllable.
Maybe how to bust like?
As we have to go to and.

James Maki   2:38:41
Yeah.
Yep, yeah, look up the sunet ID first.
There you go.
Is the Siri Internet connection a little slow?

Saravanabhavan S   2:41:50
I don't know what it was taking too long.

James Maki   2:41:52
So.
Yeah, uh, just curious if that's why these queries take so long to run.
Yeah, because these are really small queries. Like they really, like typically they shouldn't take more than a couple seconds. So yeah, it's it's great. It's crazy that you're.
Taking almost a full minute to get the get the results.

Saravanabhavan S   2:43:04
OK, James, we have done this three controllers. We have deleted this duplicates, so.

James Maki   2:43:07
Yep. So I would tell them that they can resubmit those 3.
Those 3 errors now and they should and and they should go through now.

Saravanabhavan S   2:43:25
So like that we can't tell them we can you can't resend the.
Resend this three. OK so so we have deleted so duplicate so they will have only now one unique values in what's all three control numbers.

James Maki   2:43:31
Uh, yeah.
Uh.
Yeah.
Right, right. So that should stop the error message from coming up again. So now when they go through and and now if they resubmit those, they should go through to E Oscar. Now they they shouldn't have any more problems.
That's that's just for those three though. So I did notice, I noticed last week. I think they had put in another ticket they had.
So they do have like they have a few more disputes with that same error I think.
Um.
Uh, maybe not. Actually, I'm looking through, it looks like.
Those are all something different now.
OK, so oh, there is one more.
Oh, no, that's one that you fixed. OK, yeah, that should be good. Yeah, tell them that they should, that they can resubmit and the responses should go through to Oscar now.

Saravanabhavan S   2:44:41
OK, and there's one more ticket.
Uh, this one, James.

James Maki   2:45:06
Yes. OK, so the answer to her question is no. So she's asking when they complete an ACDV, so like a regular dispute if that also responds to the block notification.
No, it does not. Responding to the ACDV only goes on the ACDV. The block notification is separate and would require a BRR to for a response.

Saravanabhavan S   2:45:38
OK.

James Maki   2:45:40
Yeah, yeah. So you can tell her. Yeah. So you can tell her no, the response is only on ACDD. It's a is a good way to phrase that.

Saravanabhavan S   2:45:42
OK.
Oh.
OK, so uh.
Uh, that's all from my my site James.

James Maki   2:45:58
OK, excellent.
All right, guys, well, we're coming up on three hours, so let's let's definitely take a break and and I'm going to go get some lunch.
If you guys have any other questions or anything else that needs to follow up on, just shoot me a message and if we need to have another call today, we can definitely do that also so.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:46:26
With Bing Music, I don't have anything.

James Maki   2:46:27
Alright guys, stay.
All right. Perfect. All right. Thanks for all your help. You guys are doing great.
Yeah, and you guys killed it. Monja, you did. You did awesome with the dev disputes. The dev disputes is definitely one of the most complicated things that we do here on the support team. So yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:46:37
Yes.

James Maki   2:46:49
Yeah, good. Good job on all that stuff. But all right, guys, thanks a lot. I'll talk to you later, OK?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:46:55
Thank you. Bye bye.

Saravanabhavan S   2:46:56
Thank you.

Manjunath S started transcription

Saravanabhavan S   0:03
I think I don't have access to a dev environment.

James Maki   0:07
You do have access 'cause I set you up.

Saravanabhavan S   0:20
So we have to see in a server, right?

James Maki   0:30
Like.

Manjunath S   0:34
Oh, I have sent a link in the chat, so I'll just open the.
OK.
This ticket backlog, upper lock.

James Maki   1:52
You didn't need me to reset it. Oh, you're doing it OK.

Saravanabhavan S   4:21
Or else I will do it later, James. So apart from that.
So yesterday we have speaking about the API, right? That one he's telling like.
He has to uh give this uh retrieve the data from step two. For that he has uh in step one you need a a date of account information and step one direct details.
So I checked with the documents. Uh.
So in step one direct we have only a code number but there is not date of account information.

James Maki   5:08
What was the ticket number again?

Saravanabhavan S   5:12
22942.

James Maki   5:39
That's.
I don't understand what he's asking.

Saravanabhavan S   5:48
So in our API documentation, so you just need to retrieve the data from step one. He need a data of account information in that here, but we have only a phone number, not about data of account number.
So like he's telling his his business practice.
So we have sent like yesterday the date of account information format like month, year, year, month, day.
That's why you're requesting like.

James Maki   6:54
I have no idea what the **** he's talking about.
I need to know which system of record data to retrieve. I don't know what he means by that.
All the account info piece of the step two body.
There is no date of count information in the step one direct details, so I don't know if I grab the most recent.
But why is that not acceptable for business practices? Why? Why would you not grab the most recent if you receive a dispute, someone saying that they don't agree with what you're charging them for or what you're like reporting on them?
Why would you not use the most recent?
Account information I.
I don't know. I have absolutely no idea. It's over my head. I I have no clue what he's asking. I don't have an answer for him. I would send this to the dev team because I don't have an answer. So you have to find someone else that does.

Saravanabhavan S   8:01
This is.

James Maki   8:02
What he's saying doesn't. Yeah, yeah, you have to. Yeah, yeah, you're. Yeah. I have absolutely no idea what he's talking about.

Saravanabhavan S   8:05
Sorry.
OK.
OK so ticket number 22965 in that they are asking about how long we able to retrieve the files. So in in the folder in the images we have. So they are asking about the image files, the files are how long it will be there like it is a.

James Maki   8:31
For for SFTP.

Saravanabhavan S   8:32
Fixed time frame or?
OK, yes.

James Maki   8:36
Hold on. All right, this is this is for HP Sears.

Saravanabhavan S   8:39
For a saptic voltage image.

James Maki   8:41
All right, we don't want to retain images like they should all like after they pick them up or if we send them to them. I don't know how these guys, I don't know who's hosting.
We're hosting.
Looks like.

Saravanabhavan S   9:04
They're asking whether we have fixed time or like.

James Maki   9:06
Yeah, I I got it. I got it. I understand.

Saravanabhavan S   9:09
OK.

James Maki   9:12
All right, so this is another group of people that aren't picking up or aren't removing any of their files. Jesus Christ, we have these files are over a year old. These mother.
2023 Oh hell no. Hell no. Get this out of here.

Manjunath S   9:29
Two years back.

Saravanabhavan S   9:34
Yes, they are having files from 2023.

James Maki   9:37
Why is my? Yeah, no, we're deleting stuff right this second. Absolutely not.

Saravanabhavan S   9:51
Yeah, hotly.
OK.

James Maki   10:07
To be holding on to these people's files for an extended period of time, but if they're leaving them on the server, we also don't have a process that's going in and removing them.
So if they're not picking them up, if they're just leaving them on our server, unless we find them and remove them like I'm about to, they'll be there forever until like until someone does something about it. But that is not our policy. That is not how we should be operating.
And it just is what it is. But why are you telling me?
I swear to God.
What is happening right now?

Saravanabhavan S   10:58
So like uh.

James Maki   11:01
Oh my God, dude. All these image files back to 2022. These have never. These people have never removed a single file off our ******* server. Oh hell no.

Saravanabhavan S   11:01
It is a we can pay them.

James Maki   11:24
Our our policy is only to maintain images for 30 days past the due date. Beyond that, we don't. We we shouldn't be maintaining them. If we find them, we're going to remove them. So this guy has left his files out there the entire time since he's been a customer of ours, apparently.

Saravanabhavan S   11:36
OK.

James Maki   11:42
And I guess we've just never noticed it. But so he has. He has all of his files out there. As of right now, he can go all the way back to 2022 and pick up his stupid *** images, which is a problem like cause that has like.
Like potentially like who knows what images are in there that could contain like like PII information and stuff that we do not want to be responsible for.
Tell him we only guarantee up to 30 days past the due date. That's the that's the answer to. That's the answer to his question.

Saravanabhavan S   12:13
OK.
OK.
On James Uh 22953 and so we so we talk about the password reset. So I tell them Sagar but he.

Manjunath S   12:21
Yes.

James Maki   12:26
I don't understand what Cigar is saying. Yeah, I was. I was gonna reply to him. I don't understand what Cigar is saying there. We can't reset his password. Like, can you reset our Pravana password? Can you reset Sabrina's password? No. So why could? So why could we reset Russ's? Yeah, like, I I don't understand what.

Saravanabhavan S   12:27
Hi, good night.
Thank you.
No, no. So I didn't even have to do the.

James Maki   12:44
The conversation is here. I don't know if Sagar got confused. Like if you like forgot what it was that were.
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   12:52
So he's not aware of the SSD. He don't have access SSD access also. So maybe think he are raising the issues to our support team.

James Maki   13:03
Yeah, he needs to get in. He needs to get in contact with the Pravana IT team. I don't know how to like other than SSD.
I don't know how he's supposed to do that, but it's not. But it's not us. Like this is the Sonnet support desk, not the Pravana support desk. We do not reset Pravana passwords. I'm annoyed that he's even sending this to us. Like he got too comfortable, I think.

Saravanabhavan S   13:14
I'll.
OK.

James Maki   13:28
Well, never mind. I'm not gonna say anything.

Manjunath S   13:29
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   13:31
OK.

James Maki   13:31
But no, I like somehow you gotta get him in touch with the Pravana IT because that's not a password that you can reset.

Saravanabhavan S   13:49
What do you manage, bro? You can go ahead, bro. I will reset the trust and my password on the.

Manjunath S   13:57
OK.
First important thing is like this one now API images.
From the Navy.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:25
Uh, Jim, I think that image issues haven't resolved it, right?

James Maki   14:35
Which images?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:41
Navy and United both image issues.

James Maki   14:46
Alright, well, Navy is talking about the API.
Yeah, United Auto does not. United Auto does not use the API.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:51
Yes.

James Maki   14:55
So I'm guessing that their ticket is something different.

Manjunath S   15:00
Yeah, this one they're like they're not able to to download the API.

James Maki   15:22
Alright, uh.
Oh.
Don't understand.
I mean, this is something that Amanda was working on. I don't know.
2.
I mean in this API call, I don't understand. I mean like like that's not an ID doesn't match. Is that supposed to be some kind of an image ID? Like I don't know what.
Like I mean the sonnet ID in their screenshot does not match the sonnet ID.
In their description.
So I don't.

Manjunath S   17:06
This one.

James Maki   17:09
Yeah, so, alright, so like, they're saying that they failed.
To get the image ID.
I I don't. I don't know. I don't understand.

Manjunath S   17:22
To be created the for this, but there is not about select.

James Maki   18:10
I mean, it's possible they've been removed. I mean Amanda's message on there from.
June 10th, 2 weeks ago it was that was that the image files were scheduled to be purged.
So, I mean, if that's what happened, if they did get purged, I mean, that kind of explains why they're getting an image not available for this dispute. I mean, that's pretty straightforward, but I don't know what.

Manjunath S   18:52
Oh.
This one that's so they're asking for the.
Step to file but when I check it there are no step to file on this particular date in the server.

James Maki   19:09
So he's saying that the step too far from that date is still on their server is what he's complaining about. So you're not. You can't pick that up with automation because it's from a past date. Automation won't pick it up. You got to go get it manually. That's the only way to do it. I I doubt that it actually matters that it's out there. I don't know. Do they still have stuff that's.

Manjunath S   19:13
Hello.
OK.
From inside Sonic.

James Maki   19:34
We have 3 disputes that are waiting for data.

Manjunath S   20:12
The script to file is missing.

James Maki   20:16
Yes, he's saying that the file is still on their server.
'Cause they're they're hosting, not us. So the file is on their server, so we have to go to their server to get the file. That's it.
So on this Navy images issue, so Sigar has a message on here from yesterday.
Saying to bring it up during our our call with the devs and you didn't do that, right?

Manjunath S   21:11
And.

James Maki   21:14
The Navy Federal ticket. You're talking to 22779.

Manjunath S   21:15
Cool.
Yeah.

James Maki   21:21
Yeah. So, so you forgot to bring it up on the call when when we had the devs there.

Manjunath S   21:30
Yeah, I forgot it.

James Maki   21:40
Alright, one thing at a time. Alright, yeah, let's do team recovery. This is, yeah, let's get this done.
And then we'll go back to the Navy thing. So you're like, you're gonna have to talk to the devs because I don't know what the expectation here is. I don't know. I'm annoyed that Amanda dumped this on us, like her putting a message on there saying that the files are about to be purged and blah blah blah.

Manjunath S   22:02
Yeah.

James Maki   22:04
Like.
Cool. That means something needs to be done about it right then. Like not just put a note on the ticket and let it happen like.
If it's that serious.
Like that should have been like a chat discussion or something like that should have been brought up. So I mean, I mean, hell, like we could have moved the files like we could have done.
Something.
So I don't know what.

Manjunath S   22:38
Should I give I guess for distance?

James Maki   22:43
Uh, no 'cause you've forgotten a very important thing.

Manjunath S   22:48
So.

James Maki   22:49
Uh, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and say yes.
But you are.
I guess it doesn't matter.

Manjunath S   23:01
You have to remove the characters or.

James Maki   23:05
Yes.
Uh.
Hold on. I don't think so, actually. I think you've already done that.
Uh.
All right, maybe you do need to remove.
Check my version.
2.

Manjunath S   24:03
Maybe ought to get a sort of.

James Maki   24:07
Yeah, that's what you didn't do.

Manjunath S   24:11
Yeah, so.

James Maki   24:11
Uh, you do need to remove. You do need to remove the.
Do you? Is that an escape character?

Manjunath S   24:20
Permission is denied.

James Maki   24:26
Yeah, I think they have really strict security settings and I think we're blocked.

Manjunath S   24:39
Should I inject from this?

James Maki   24:41
Do control C to exit to stop what you're doing.
So I think we're gonna have to wait a while now because I think that.
Whenever you have a failed login with these guys.
I think it blocks you.
For some amount of time.
Yeah, yeah. All right. So we're not gonna be able to connect under server for a while. So yeah, so we can't do anything on that now.

Manjunath S   25:21
OK.

James Maki   25:32
Uh, we need. We need to.
We need to talk to a man about this.
Because I don't like, I have absolutely no idea. Like, I I hate that they're continuously just dumping us in the middle of things that are like ongoing and that like other people already have knowledge about and know what's happening. And then we're just apparently expected to just come in and just figure it out.
Like, I'm really over that. It's.

Manjunath S   26:57
So what do we do for the steps? Any idea?

James Maki   27:05
Ask Amanda.

Manjunath S   27:14
So if I can go or should I?

James Maki   27:39
I'm gonna check on the API server.

Manjunath S   30:28
Should I try to correct Tinder Sagun for the Tingle recovery?

James Maki   30:47
You can try.

Manjunath S   31:03
Password. We don't need this dash B right? Only this one.

James Maki   31:10
To take out the escape character.

Manjunath S   31:24
That's it, right?

James Maki   31:27
Yes, that's right.

Manjunath S   31:37
Denied.

James Maki   31:51
All right, control C It's not gonna let you on.
I I don't know how long it takes for it to.
Refresher, whatever it is it needs to do.

Manjunath S   32:13
This is.
Do you have it in a video of those those terms?

James Maki   34:02
I don't have answers to any of those questions. This has turned into a really a really ****** day.

Manjunath S   34:06
OK.

James Maki   34:14
As of right now, I don't believe that there is any process to clear out block notifications from Sonnet. I think they are there forever as of right now. I don't think they ever go away. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty confident about that.

Manjunath S   34:25
Yes.

James Maki   34:30
So #2, the answer is no. I feel like didn't we just answer that for somebody else? Was that the same person? Probably.
And I don't know what a good contact number is anymore. Is it still the Sun support desk? Like you guys get those calls, right?
The phone number is still the same. I have no idea. No one tells me anything.

Manjunath S   34:59
OK.
Yeah.
So.
Should we respond on this or just for a reference, shall I attach the ACDP PDF?
Games.

James Maki   36:59
Mhm.

Manjunath S   36:59
Yeah, so they responded.

James Maki   37:02
I'm I'm reading. I'm looking, I'm looking. I'm trying to find an answer 'cause I don't know.
I don't have all the answers, so we got to figure it out. And the only way to do that is to start looking. So right now I'm in the knowledge base in Zendesk, looking at an article on block notifications, trying to see if there's any information that's going to help us.

Manjunath S   37:14
Yeah.

Saravanabhavan S   41:39
OK.

James Maki   41:52
Yes.
Can you guys hear me?

Manjunath S   42:42
Distance.

James Maki   42:45
OK, apparently I'm having Internet troubles.
So you might lose me.

Manjunath S   42:53
No, already there is a breakage in the walls.

James Maki   43:16
Something is wrong.
What's going on?

Manjunath S   43:40
I can see this later.

James Maki   43:48
Yeah, it's really weird. Like the call is still active, but everything else on my computer is down.

Manjunath S   43:56
OK.

James Maki   43:58
I I don't have any access to Sonnet.
No, nothing is responding.
Not sure what's going on.
And it says I'm disconnected from the VPN. I don't understand how the call is still active. I'm so confused. What the **** is happening?
OK, can I please get my Internet? Hello.

Manjunath S   44:37
Cool.

James Maki   44:44
But.
What the hell is going on?

Manjunath S   48:17
Jim, show connected.

FILE 97: UI Stuff 2.txt
================================================================================

*to find which controller the logic is in, just find the route in web.php

Dashboard

Dispute Backlog and Volume Per Day we use echarts
Changes are in dashboard.js (echart logic) and dashboard controller and dashboardHiome.blade

The tiles are in dashboardHome.blade but we use dashboard controller for the logic. 

The query for tiles is from the dispute table
Query for vpd from daily_totals table (not currently running in uat) except images which is dispute table – new pr making whole vpd graph asynchronous 

Reasons come from default_dispute_reason for the description and the dispute table for most popular dispute codes this month


As a Sonnet user, I want to see the number of disputes with images for 30 days regardless of status so that I can monitor my volume of disputes with images.

Load dashboard data in without making Sonnet slow

The problem is that there are so many disputes on the dispute table and the vpd images is not in the daily_totals table so ultimately for speed sake we just took out the  Complwted disputes from the graph, but that looks weird. Navy recently noticed that it looked weird so we need to address this.

After discussing with Lidi, we decided we needed to make the vpd data retrival asynchronous.  

We need a new method in the controller for this, so see pr 2302 https://dev.azure.com/Palinode/Sonnet/_git/4e242732-d1dc-47ab-a7d7-4ebce03855aa/pullrequest/2302

We need a new route in web.php and we need to update the data retrieval in dashboard.js to use ajax. 

As a Sonnet user, I want to see the number of disputes received for the day on the Dispute Received today tile so that I can see the actual number of disputes receiving.  On 08/05/2024 the download for 08/04/2024 was delayed so the count is showing 0, but there were 2909 disputes downloaded for the day, but the tile is still showing 0.  The volume line graph at the bottom and this tile should match.

Basically for this one the query was wrong at it was only looking for disputes created on before today and not today. Including this to show that all the dashboard queries are in the dashboardcontroller.

https://dev.azure.com/Palinode/Sonnet/_git/4e242732-d1dc-47ab-a7d7-4ebce03855aa/pullrequest/1939


 
Tiles are all in the dashboardHome blade. If you want to make a new one, just create the query or whatever data you want in the controller and then update the blade and css and voila.  

https://dev.azure.com/Palinode/Sonnet/_git/4e242732-d1dc-47ab-a7d7-4ebce03855aa/pullrequest/471

dispute.js

		
As a Sonnet user, I want Sonnet to update the consumer comparison indicators as I make changes to the consumer information so that I can save a step.

When the dispute is processed through the rules engine, the consumer comparison indicators are set.  The user can update the recommended response values and then Sonnet automatically updates the comparison indicator.  The user can also change the comparison indicator against sonnet's recommendation which will result in the user getting an error and be unable to submit.

I am searching in dispute.js for anywhere that has .addClass("eoscar-warning");
Instead of sending false validation, change the indicator if it pertains to the _comparison

We do some of them differently (names and addresses) so you also need to search _comparison and make sure you’re not returning true for any comparison

If you make changes in js or css, don’t forget npm run dev to see the changes

https://dev.azure.com/Palinode/Sonnet/_git/sonnet-app-20/pullrequest/2312




When the response code 01, 12, 21, 22, 23, or 24 then the ssn and dob comparison indicator should be selected and not left blank.  Do not allow the user to navigate away from the consumer information if the ssn and dob comparison indicator is left blank.  Should function like the middle name field and comparison


So when the ssn, dob, or middle_name fields are blank, the inicator has to be Unk and not blank 
  function isValidDate(dateString, dateType = "") {
    // blank is OK

    if (dateType == "dob" && dateString == "" && $('select[name="dob_comparison"]').val() != "Unk") {
      $('select[name="dob_comparison"]').val('Unk').change;
      verify_consumer_fields()
      return true;
    } else if (dateType == "dob" && dateString != "" && $('select[name="dob_comparison"]').val() == "") {
      $('select[name="dob_comparison"]').val('Unk').change;
      verify_consumer_fields()
      return true;
    } else if (dateType == "dob" && dateString == "" && $('select[name="dob_comparison"]').val() == "Unk") {
      return true;
    } else if (dateType != "dob" && dateString == "") {
      return true;
    }



User used the consumer information indicator E without a DOFD and was able to complete in Sonnet, but the dispute was returned with a response error - FCRA 1st Date of Delinquency is required when Consumer Information Indicator is E. Sep 27th, 2023, 8:25:39am CDT.  

The user then corrects the response error and inputs the DOFD, but Sonnet will not allow the user to complete as it produces the error 

https://dev.azure.com/Palinode/Sonnet/_git/4e242732-d1dc-47ab-a7d7-4ebce03855aa/pullrequest/1264

this is old but if Date of Delinquency must have a value if consumer information indicator is 'E'


Reports (most common UI request)

e-Oscar Report Card is showing different totals between the total number of items based on the response type and the total number of items based on the response time. The response type is showing the correct number so need to identify where the extras are coming from for the All eOscar Queues.

Reports are in either acdvreportsservice (dispute), directreportservice, customreportservice, audreportservice, brrreportservice, 

If the customer wants any report that is just for them, put it in custom so we’re not cluttering up the main reports with if statements

For the above bug, the fix was in the accdvreportsservice and the function was eoscarReportCardReport. You can look for the title from the browser and then the function related to it to find the report

As a Sonnet user, I want to see a Direct Dispute Checklist report for each Direct Dispute Completed in Sonnet with the Sonnet ID, Account Number, Date Complete, User who completed and each checklist item so that I can have better reporting for checklist utilization for Direct Disputes.

This was a brand new report request but it was one that we wanted to globally offer so we wrote a new array item in the constructor for directreportsservice. Each of those things get sent in the payload to return the needed information. And then the function is where you would go to write the query.

Getting an error


This was happening in the blade. When you run that report to see the error, the category will tell you which service is is, the the name will tell you which function it is, and then the function name is the blade name (plus blade.php at the end)

eOscar API credential mgmt-20250630_230508-Meeting Recording
June 30, 2025, 5:35PM
48m 7s

Lidiexy Alonso   0:03
Yeah, day to you.
So during during that process of checking what is in the queue, you know you know what it is and everyone knows right now what is the responses and all that the numbers while piling up.

James Maki   0:06
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   0:18
So something is now good here.
Normally you will expect that in the morning around 8 probably will still, you know be a little bit of you know like.
A backlog, but after sometimes you start seeing oh.
Why this is going to not and sometimes just is because we stop.
The responses happened.
That's one case, but we didn't.
So we really want that.
If it was running and then I remember, oh, maybe because we did a restart of all the services, all the services in this weekend we did patching. OK, let me double check if they are running.
But yes, they were running.
Not a problem.
So all the responses were running as you can see.
I just run it again, but it was.
Everything was like that, like everything was running, the Chrome tab was, you know, like this. Like everything was OK and then what I did in the morning, I mentioned it to to James was let me stop one server, right.
And this is the server that I stopped response 01.
Let me show you real quick.
You see.
I stopped responses for this server.
And even the AUD submission right acdb submission and AUD submission, I stopped that.
And then I put this back.
It was like a couple of minutes ago.
Right. Couple of minutes ago I put it back.
So if I run it now, I don't need to run this one, but this is the command that we run.
We cannot target companies with submit. That's bummer.
We should, but he's not.
He's not built yet.
So what I was doing was this with both server stop, right?
Just running the command we I changed to Sona Yoskar connector.
So what I did was change to sonnet.
Yours got connected right.
And then start running this command.
No app dash.
O is the operation. When I was doing that.
Some customer pop up and I put it in the chat so it start popping.
Let me get here.
So start popping RECO.
It's still an issue.
Start popping abcu Atlanta postal and I saw this. This was.
The password and I changed it to this one.
How do I did it? You know how migrate that company specifically and I will show you it's right here.
Is this one I believe.
No, I don't know one of them.
So as you can see, this is RECO.
Greco again.
Maybe this one, I don't know.
Yeah, he's that one.
He's that one.
You see that this is Alana postal. All good.
So I run this and then seems like works OK let me see.
I start running this in order to get it, but I was enabled to get it.
How do I test that real quick?
If that is, if that is correct or not.
Because I'm curious about it.
Right. I want to know.
Honestly, I want to know if that password is correct.
So for RECO and the others, the others was easy because I just run this command ICTP submit and they pop up real quick.
But not for Atlanta, Atlanta.
So it's hard for me here in the they have some responses to get to do, but it's it's not getting there. Why maybe.
The automation maybe the wrong, but it was everything stopped.
So what?
I will do is just schedule a new download for Alana postal.
ABC.

James Maki   4:24
Yeah, so I'm confused 'cause. I'm not showing a login error on Atlanta postal.

Lidiexy Alonso   4:28
I did fix it.

James Maki   4:29
Oh, you did fix it, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   4:30
So in the responses we have issues.
Of course this is.
This is running for a long time. If I to go up I will not find it, but there I guess I have the error for some of them.
The error I'd send it to me, sunrise for example.
This is there that we are giving.
We are getting instead.
Imagine, instead surprise. It was apcl, right?
It was this same error.
You are not logging fail blah blah. Check your password.
OK, for for Ipco and startup typing.

James Maki   5:00
Mm H.

Lidiexy Alonso   5:03
So all of them here recovered the first one, APCO one, the second one, and then I say, OK, rec.
Apcu has only one company.
Why this is happening?
Oh, maybe because the migrate didn't work.
Let me run it again and then I run it again with this password in the database and this is the new password right now and it was success. All good. Awesome.
So is this right here you see?
That everything processed.
This is the password and no error.
All good.
So I I I thought, oh, everything is good.
But let's go to test if that is correct or not.
So I will do another line of postal no now.
I mean now, sorry. Now only a one time only. And I scheduled that. But before that, I need to prep myself to put Alana postal in a download mode so I can see here.
And not, you know, looking in the logs, it's something happens. So I will be ready in RPA.
No happy A/C to one, sorry.
RPA 02 is what I need.
The RPA O2.
So let me fix it up.
RPA 02 so I have API 02 to change passport here RPA O2 to execute downloads.
I will go to the Oscar connector, which is the one doing that, and then if I execute right now, there is nothing in the in the in the queue for them to download, right?

James Maki   6:56
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   6:57
So if I do.
This now we will have something in the queue and yes voila is connected. It is OK. It's downloading.
So the password is OK.
So now I can go here and I will say.
All git, so this is the new password.
Oh.
So I would forget about APC same as you see.
Avadime avai or whatever is this fix it?

James Maki   7:32
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   7:33
See these two were errors that now are.
Fix it.
We are still have issues with the RECO on consumer rights, OK.

James Maki   7:40
Alright, so so for Revco.
They do have multiple companies, right?

Lidiexy Alonso   7:45
Yep, right here.

James Maki   7:46
And so it looks like they. Yeah. And so it looks like they do have. It looks like they're all downloading separately so.
Like so? Like if? Yeah, exactly.
All right. Oh, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   7:58
Mm hmm.

James Maki   7:58
And you do have the password copied. OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:01
Yep. So what happened this morning when I saw the first one I saw was redpo.
What I did, and that's why is is the chat right.
The first one in the chat, so I saw this one.
Who? I saw this here.
And these three were that right.
That's exactly what I saw when I get in this morning to try and figure out what's what the heck is going on.

James Maki   8:22
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:24
So I saw that I said, whoa, that's the problem, right?
OK.
Let me change it back.
I change everything to this.
I just change everything to this and save right.

James Maki   8:38
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:38
But.
When I run it again, Redcoat came came in again.
Aw error again.
Oh, maybe the password was the other.
That's why I put those the two password here.
Oh, the password was not that. It probably this was. Was this one. OK, cool.

James Maki   8:49
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:54
Then I go back and update it again, back to whatever it was.
Let me refresh and that's it, change the database.
No, OK, I change it to this.
All of them the same.

James Maki   9:04
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   9:06
Run it again RECO again with error.
What I didn't know what to do right.
So both passwords that I have in my logic, they were wrong.

James Maki   9:18
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   9:18
OK, so I said OK.
Let me change the password.
We migrate, right?
That should be the case. Then I leave it this way and I I migrate REFCO 15600. When I did this error the password that you have is not the correct password so.
I was unable to change the password with these as the password as they correct old password.
Right. So maybe what's the other? And then put it back, so I put the other back this one.
Right and then right?
Save these and run it again.
Migrate that reco.
Error. What error? Everything was on error.
No matter what password I put, was returning on error. OK, I said. Well, OK, let me put every company of Repco here. Just go into organization 5600.
And then for every.
Single company sorry member credential ID in this case all of them.
This is the ID.
I went OK. OK.
You are.
You are the best, OK?
I will go back.
You know, haunting you right now.
So this one OK, when I go out, I put it here, then. Oh, enter then log in. Error safe.

James Maki   10:42
Yeah.
Alright.

Lidiexy Alonso   10:52
The next one log in error safe.
The next one loading error.
Safe, but this one, especially this one.
When I copy that one, it was down submitting.
It was submitting with this pass.

James Maki   11:08
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   11:08
Oh, what's going on here? We don't know.
I just remove this and put the lawyer on site. That's what I did.
James he was about to say something.

James Maki   11:19
Yeah, alright.
So just looking at their company settings like just looking at their schedules, so the only one that hasn't actually has the download scheduled is the main company and they do have subscriber code splitting turned on.
So I think everything should just be running through the main company from what it looks like.
So in addition to that, I also saw that you have four sets of credentials, but they only have three companies.
So it looks like.
So CRS is the one that is apparently duplicated for some reason, and I and I have no idea how that happened.

Lidiexy Alonso   11:54
Mm hmm.
Yeah, maybe. When when we do something like this, let me show you real quick. When we do something like this, James sometimes.
When we do update, sometimes when you are doing migrate, sometimes we create new. I need to check why but sometimes we are creating a new credential which is not OK.

James Maki   12:08
Mm hmm.
OK.
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's gonna be a problem.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:21
Mm hmm.

James Maki   12:22
All right, so it looks like in this case it looks like ID 5783 that second one.
Yeah, it looks like that's that's the duplicate for for CRS.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:29
A duplication.
A duplication.

James Maki   12:31
Yeah. So I don't know if we just wanna go ahead and delete that.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:35
I will.
I'm doing it now.

James Maki   12:37
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:38
Oh, don't.
What's going on here?

James Maki   12:39
But then it looks like.
Yeah, I mean, it looks like we don't need those credentials.
On CRS and and the pit P ITT.
Like if they don't have it, if they, if they don't download scheduled and they are also not.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:58
Oh.

James Maki   13:05
Like the responses should all be running through the main company, right?
Or at least as far as like.
Like as far as like the Oscar's concerned.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:13
I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure about that, but responses can have multiple if it's the same is the same.
So you can have 3-4 whatever credentials with the same 4 responses doesn't matter.

James Maki   13:26
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:26
Download is is the is the main issue and the download we are using this one normally.
So what's happening now?

James Maki   13:32
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:34
Yep.
What happening now is these credential has.
Responses attached.
Let's do it.
So let's go to responses team response queue.
Member credential ID is equal to.
Please client.
And well, I don't know if we completed or not.
So probably we have completed also.
So what do we do?
Then company we have company here that company but we don't organization right.
Yeah, we don't have organization, OK.
Let's do.
And company ID.
In then that will be 1660.
Let me start with the one because that's the one that we need right now.
Yep, and all of them are complete.
So we complete some disputes.
With that credential, by the way.

James Maki   14:48
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   14:49
And they were complete.
Today, no.
Two days ago.

James Maki   14:56
Yeah. Friday 27th. Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   14:58
Yeah, yeah. Friday.
So we can do something right because we want.
Let's check if we have work for that for this one for the 80.
A bunch more, right? So OK.

James Maki   15:11
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:14
Let's let's do this.
Azulis. OK, let's save here.
And then let's go on delete this one.
So we have less headaches.

James Maki   15:29
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:31
There you go. OK, less headaches right now.

James Maki   15:31
Yeah. All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:35
But in 27.
This password was working.
Oh, that's a good that's a good point. So Friday.
These password was the one assigned to this company.
And it was working.

James Maki   15:54
Mm H.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:55
So today these new password probably when you run the command James this new password was here.

James Maki   16:06
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:07
So when we do that, we need to go with those and change all the password to do the same.
So this is the the process. Normally when you go you need to go with those that you know that has multiple companies with the same password and you need to update just in case update all those just to have to avoid issues.

James Maki   16:25
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:26
But the the problem now is that seems like we lock.
The accounts.
It's my. It's my humble opinion.
I don't know what's going on, but.
Nor this one or the other.

James Maki   16:40
Yeah, I mean, I mean like if if, like responses like we're trying to submit like on one of the other companies that didn't.
Like that.
Didn't update or something like that.
Like maybe that's what's causing it.
Umm.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:52
So at this point I will say customer I will, I will talk with the customer.
Hey guys. We need you to reset the password and then we will just reset it again and make sure that we do it.
You know, we do it properly and change all the password because if something is running like responses and it's taking these and erroring out is using the same RECO right? And if?
Multiple times.
And this is different then you know that will make a mess.
And that's exactly why it was the stock, the responsible stock.
This is one of the cases. So right now all of dynamic vlogging error.

James Maki   17:26
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:29
So we need to talk with the customer in order to reset this.
That's one thing.

James Maki   17:32
Right.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:34
But this is getting more interesting.
This makes sense.
All good that happens.
I will go to the most interesting case, sunrise.
Sunrise this morning has an error. When I was trying to submit right, I was submitting from Reiser. Boom. Say OK.

James Maki   17:50
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:53
Oh, look at this.
This one also has error.
That's a good point.
Look at this.
Our RSA MD OK.
Let's look for that.
That's what I did.
Perfect, perfect timing.
So say blah blah blah.
So who is this?
RSI Enterprise Thirty 3800. So oh, we have subcompanies.
Oh, this is probably getting to the same case of the other. Let's let's go to the database.
Organization. 3838 hundred. Yeah. Yeah, we have these.
Then I will do what I did this morning.
RSA.
Password one current.
Please.
And then give an error right?
That's giving some errors, so we double check that company 123 all good.
So there is the same thing is exact same case as what is the other sunrise.
No sunrise, no. James. I'm here.

James Maki   19:06
Revco revco.

Lidiexy Alonso   19:07
Yeah, it's the same case as Reko.
So cool.
We have this a problem. We have a problem here, but all the passwords are the same.
Hmm, let me.
Go to the responses and this will be company ID 3800.
Then all good.
So we respond last time.
Order by.
This Friday.
We respond on Friday.
OK, makes sense.
Maybe we have the issue right in Friday.
Expire blah blah blah. OK, let me look for one.
Nothing for one.
Of course, because they are different member credentials.
Lady, come on yourself.
This is all one.
Are you sure that 01? There's nothing here.
I get to get this next one.
Is it 402?
Nothing. Get the third one.
This is for outside.
There you go. We have something.
Maybe these two companies or one or two, maybe they're deactivated or something.
I don't want to go details on that, but there is no responses for these two.
But there is for this awesome.
Response queue. What was the last time?
18.
So a couple more days ago.
Cool. We have Friday anything makes sense.
James.

James Maki   20:50
Not just 18 tests. Well, 12 days ago.

Lidiexy Alonso   20:53
Yep, so there is no nothing else for 2:30 AO 203 in this case.

James Maki   20:58
OK, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:00
I don't know.
Maybe. Maybe we have some our RSASASE.

James Maki   21:01
All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:05
So maybe we have some and they're active company seems like it, but we have.
We have nothing for this one, nothing for this one.
OK.
Let's move on.

James Maki   21:16
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:16
When I saw these, I said OK.
This is the case of Reco, right, OK, OK.
Let me try to update that company.
Let me migrate that company.
At least try to do it 3800.
So the re company ID, yes.
Then monitoring this Member credentials and this is the password.
Good. I already put put this here now.
I didn't send it.
Let me send it.
Then we migrate.
He said that we will try to change the password.
The password has been changed. All good.
Voila, almost finish. So let me check now the database.
Refresh and voila, it changed only for one company. I need to put it everywhere.
That's what I do.
Or what?
That's what we do.
Who today we were update all the companies blah blah with the same password. Awesome.
The problem now is how to test.
So how to get it there?
It's difficult, right?
That's the problem.
We don't know if that password will be correct or not.
Now it's karmar, but so we would never get into that one.
Let's do a download for them to test it.
So let's go to schedule download.
3800.
Download 10.
Right now.
This ready for?
3800.
Add schedule pranet.
Mm hmm, trying trying trying.
It's downloading, so the password is correct.
Everything is correct the the.
The responses should be correct.
That's what I was expecting for RECO, but it didn't happen.
OK.
So all good.
All good, right?
I know we we cleared this one.
And then I would communicate with you.
So new pass.
Blah fix it.
Or all good. Whatever, right?

James Maki   23:51
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   23:52
OK.
All good.
So we still have more, but this is the interesting part.
We never get into this one sunrise. When I went to Run's Rice, it's only one company.
Sunrise. So is this company so 12700?

James Maki   24:05
Here it is. Yes. Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   24:10
He's only one company that you have only one US credential and all that. This is easy peasy. Super easy.
You will see when here, right?
I went all the step that I mentioned already, right when here you can see here.
Oh, new password. All good password succeed. All good.
Yeah, I'm done with that.
Even if you see.
In my chat that was so easy that I didn't put the password one.
I didn't put what was the current password.
I didn't went here to check for that company.
I was so confident that I didn't copy the old password.
And I put only the new one and put new password and everything.
Let me tell you, after that it didn't work.
So, lady, what the heck? I don't know. This is.
This is one of the mysteries.
So if I change the password and of course of course I test a download for them and as you can see, it's right here still right here an easy error.
So we changed the password.
As somehow.
We block it or do something, but it's not working.
So what else we need to do?
Nothing, because I tested several times later to try to reset the password again and it's impossible.
I I also did it here, you know, with, with, with this request and doing it manually, just calling the database I call in the the Oscar directly and nothing works so.
I think this is another case where we need to talk with the customer and say hey guys.
Somehow the password has to be reset.
Please reset it and send it to us and then we need to do the process that we know with the customer.
But it is super interesting that we get a password to see it with some with this, not this one.
But you know what I mean.
This one right here.
So we get a password to see and after that password succeed and everything should be OK.
It was still an error.
So we need to investigate why.
Later so I think. But I will say that maybe because this is what running.
I was running that at the same time multiple times.
I get it.
And it was an error still cache.
You can scream any other type of reasons, but it could be anything mystery this, this one or another error, right?
This is a new error right now so.
You see, this is interesting.
We need to call to the customer and.
And and reset this and so and so forth.
But this was the most interesting case because it was OK, only one company.
I don't need to go to the database and nothing like that.
But I will go now, right?
And we have only one thing, so nothing.
This is good, but it's not working.
OK.
This is the interest of case.
We have another case right now, just we figure out.
Let's go do the same process.
Company.
This is only one company.
Should be easy, right?
But I will not trust me anymore anymore.
3400.
OK.
This is the password.
Current password.
Neil.
Then I will go here and try.
To 35, right?
Don't remember now 34.
31.
Let's see.
Finger Cross seems to be OK.
Seems to be OK.
This is running the responses, so if we get it here and we have an error at the same time I don't know.
We got very blocked. Whatever. So let me double check that in the database we have the new password.
We're all good.
Let me put it here.
Now we need to test now.
So how do we test?
We schedule a new download for national recovery.
This one.
10 disputes one time, but I need to prep in my.
Download.
3400.
Add to schedule go back front and run.
There you go.
Log in to sis. So Susie.
Sorry all good.
So we fixed that one too.
But you saw it's easy when it's only one company, but that's on rice just didn't work the way we want it.
And that's what I've been doing for this morning pretty much.
Just running, checking, fixing the errors, fixing companies just to clear out this volume here to dashboard acdvs this volume here it was 11 or 12,000 at some point. Right now it's just three, whatever, but 1000 only is for sunrise.
We need to fix this pretty quick.
So that's the thing. I so any questions?

James Maki   30:15
All right, so ref ref, ref. Co and sunrise, those are the two we need to reach out to, right. All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:19
Yep.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:22
What about self?

James Maki   30:28
What about self?

Lidiexy Alonso   30:29
Self Lib Bank what's happening with self?

James Maki   30:33
Some of the control number errors.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:34
OK.
This is so yeah.
Sorry, sorry it's not related.
Yeah, the control number is they are like continuously opening those tickets.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:44
What but, but with fixed ad the 700 the other day.

James Maki   30:51
They have 800 and they have 870 in their area right now.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:51
We have more.

James Maki   30:56
So those are all.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:56
And.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:56
But.

James Maki   30:57
Those are not all control number errors, but there is a lot of them.

Lidiexy Alonso   31:02
Hold on. Hold on.
So you're telling me that?
Of course we did.
We did not deploy the fix for the duplication of the rule sending, so you're telling me that we have again no touch that are duplicating the rules engine.
In the the in the response que.
Is what you're saying.

James Maki   31:23
Let me double check.
Not not sure if there are no touch or not.
Alright, that one is.
So there's a mix.
Some of them are in attention, some of them are not.

Lidiexy Alonso   31:38
OK.
So let me count all the 2521400 right?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   31:45
Yeah, company ID.
Supriya Manju keep an eye on self ticket and just drop a message to them as soon as we are, you know.
Resolving it.
Getting uneasy every passing hour.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   32:11
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:12
OK. Do you think that I can, I can just wait for you to reach RECO and Sunrise.

Manjunath S   32:14
OK, Sagar.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:20
And do you want me to move?
To keep running the you know, just let the let the servers run the responses and do.
Do not do this process anymore.
Manual process anymore to identify more.
Or or and then to jump into that issue with with their duplicates so.
So why?
Because you know, if this is priority.

James Maki   32:43
Yeah, I think that's.
I think that's fine.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:46
OK.

James Maki   32:48
Yeah. All right.
So so when we get those new passwords. So for us, do you wanna do you want to just send them to you or do you want us to try and fix these?
So we so we can.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:56
So I need the password, the reset password right for each of them.

James Maki   32:59
OK.
OK.
All right, so support guys.
So what we need to do?
Is we need to make tickets for those two companies for Revco and Sunrise credit.
So if you go over to their company and look at their list of users.
Find whoever their admin is.
And you're going to generate and you're going to make a new ticket in their name.
And you're gonna ask them?
To please reset the password.
For our E Oscar API login.
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:41
OK.

James Maki   33:43
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:44
James, please look my screen.
Everyone please.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   33:48
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:48
You see that is there is not duplication right now.

James Maki   33:54
Look in E Oscar response table.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:59
You ask a response table.

James Maki   34:00
Yeah, change it from response queue.
Change it to E Oscar response.
We have to do a little bit different because actually I don't, I don't think company ID exists on that.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:13
Yeah.

James Maki   34:13
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:15
No, no, no, he's not.

James Maki   34:15
I can't remember now. Yeah, yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:16
He's not, he's just expired.
He's the prid.
But in the, at least in the response queue, we have 00 duplicates.

James Maki   34:26
Right.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:27
So should not be.
The responsive might be.
The user corresponds, as you say.

James Maki   34:31
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:34
So in order to do that, we will do something similar to.
These.
That being a little bit more complicated.
No.
Uh.
OK.
Where?
Are.
Hmm.
OK.
So what dispute ID?
Is Anthony bla correspo response?
I guess we need to do multiple joins here.

James Maki   36:07
Yeah. Problem.

Lidiexy Alonso   36:10
Yeah.
You are.
So.
Yeah, we'll be.
OK.
Is purely.
OK.
So in a joint blah blah company is equal to blah.
And.
And.
Sona, status please.
You want to complete.
No, I cannot do that.
Because they they are some, some of them are.
What else?
Oh, I don't need these.
I need these here.
OK, now make sense.
Maybe this will give me what I need.
Sure.
Ah.
And this might be related with the same idea of resenting, you know.
Running twice for those companies for those disputes.
I mean two entities.

James Maki   38:40
Yeah, that might be on some of them.
Yeah, might be on some of them.
Like the no touch ones, you mean?
Oh really?

Lidiexy Alonso   38:51
Running if you are running.
Two, the rules engine is running with two instances for the same dispute. If we don't have any like a select before insert into the response, the Oscar response will be duplicated right with the same data by the way.

James Maki   39:14
Oh, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:15
But but only the note Tosh will have a duplicated entry in the response queue.
So so you got it right.

James Maki   39:25
I got got you.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:26
You got it.

James Maki   39:27
Yep.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:29
So that that might happen.
Yep, I know there is a lot of them.
So let me.
Group by blah.
OK, we might do something like.
So we might download these accounts.
How many we have?
That is not so many.
Not so many.
So let's go.
Not so many.
Let's go on.
There you go. So we have.
457 duplicates and I can copy this.
Send it to you.

James Maki   40:26
Just send me the query because yeah, because yeah, because.
Yeah, because that's exactly what I was gonna do. Is, I was gonna take those IDs from there and then just do like another select statement to get the IDs from the E Oscar Response Table.

Lidiexy Alonso   40:30
OK.
OK.
Yes, exactly.

James Maki   40:39
And then, yeah, and then go. Yeah. So then group those together and then. Yeah. And then I can. And then and then I can dedupe. Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   40:43
Let me order by.
Let me do the order by.
Yep, order.
By.
And they put here.
As a Kent or the Bicent?
My thing is descendant.
I think is that if not, just delete the other by and then do it the way you you want.

James Maki   41:11
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   41:15
There you go.

James Maki   41:17
Cool.

Lidiexy Alonso   41:18
So this is to find.
That duplicates.
Being eoscar response.
10.
There you go.
Yeah. Do you think?
Clean up.
Clean that up.
So Yep.
What else?
I think that's the issue.
So we need to.
We need to include on that logic in the. This is, yeah, there you go.
So this is we need to include into the logic.
Not only the the submit this submit response, so not only here in the response queue where is the change they made.
Response.
Queue now.
This one you see that I have a select first and then insert.
In the one that we have.
Insert probably this one as well.
Look for the fire response.
So we are probably doing this as well, so we need to do the same in five response in aniosco response.
You see that is just a straight to insert.
If it run it multiple times, that's the issue. So we will insert here and for sure we will insert here as well.

James Maki   42:40
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   42:45
So that's another issue that we will have and I will just, you know change.
The fax response and everything will be OK.
Oh, order by.
Probably order is a problem.
OK.
OK, I will now use the order by.
So you need to remove the other by names.
It's not, it's not correct.

James Maki   43:24
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   43:26
Then.
I will respect the same 457 entries.
Look at this, none of them.
Zero man.
Put ascend then.
0 nothing.

James Maki   43:47
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   43:49
So that is weird.
There the logic in the rules engine.
Will insert the facts sub fact response pretty much after or before the Oscar response is inserted. If we go here.
You will see that the.
It is updated fax data.
Instead it was corresponds.
Insert the fax response and this is where. After that just delete from the response queue for the dispute queue. So those.
Two, if this is duplicate, this should be duplicate.
Should be.
It's not, but it should be.

James Maki   44:30
Yes.

Lidiexy Alonso   44:32
OK.
I don't know what else I need to check where where other place we have these.
And as you can see, it's only there.
So here is the only call.
So how in the world we have your corresponds duplicated?
If five points is not duplicated, let me check. Let me check for five response. Right now only one place.
So something fishy is going on here.
Anyway, I will update the Yosko response plus the fax response just in case to select first.
And then.
And then, oh, we have a delete from yourscre.
This is interesting.

James Maki   45:21
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   45:21
OK.
May I will work with that because we have a delete here for because if you pass something here, you pass the pure ID probably or something like that. You are able to blah delete.
Same. Oh, this is the thing.
That's why we don't have a duplicate.
Because five response delete before inserting every single time.

James Maki   45:48
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   45:49
While.
He also responds.
Only delete if we pass a parameter.
On the bottom side, I gave you that later.
What will be the bottom?
Is here the Oscars point is 0.
I don't know.
What is that in zero?
But I I will be pretty fine.
And that's exactly why. So we only delete.
If the bottom is something.
That's the trick.
And we did this eight years ago, man.
So. So yeah, let me fix this somehow.

James Maki   46:26
Across.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:32
That will fix the response as well.

James Maki   46:37
No. OK, cool.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:38
What else?

James Maki   46:41
I think that's all I got for right now.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:43
As soon as you you delete those entries in the record. Once we're not have an issue.
If we run it again manually or whatever, we will probably have it so as soon as we deploy this logic that I'm creating right now, we will limit not not delete completely but limit the the issue.
And we will have one case whatever, but we should not have it.
Cool. Thank you. Ice being a pleasure.

James Maki   47:14
Right.
Yep. Thank you, Dave.

Lidiexy Alonso   47:18
Yep, you have a good day. Bye.

James Maki   47:21
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   47:22
See ya.

James Maki   47:28
I'm sending out another meeting invite for us here in a little bit, but.
Yeah. And take a look of a break.
Yeah, but definitely I get those tickets out to sunrise and refgo to get those credentials updated, guys and then?
And uh and we'll, we'll pick up where we left off with your your tickets here in a little bit servan.
Oh, he's already gone, OK.
All right.
Well, I'll you guys again here soon.
I'm gonna send out to our meeting invite, OK?

Manjunath S   48:00

Manjunath S started transcription

   0:07
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:32
Which one in this? The first one?

James Maki   0:38
Yeah, I mean the main company.
So you're looking for their admins, yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:28
So we have to reset his password.

James Maki   1:32
No, we need to reach out to them and have them reset our E Oscar API password.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:39
OK.
API password reset.

James Maki   2:10
All right.
Alright, so you don't wanna make yourself the requester. We wanna put this in their name.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:39
Oh, where in the subject?

James Maki   2:43
No, as as the requester.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:45
In that question, OK.

James Maki   3:05
Yeah, and then and then you'll make yourself the assignee.
So it would be your ticket.
And so we're we're just asking her to reset our E Oscar API password and that's that's all we need.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   4:16
Or no sunrise also.

James Maki   4:17
Right, right. Yeah. Sunrise credit is the other one.
Uh, Yep.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   6:52
OK.
What to tell him, James?

James Maki   7:01
I I don't want to answer them right now. I I don't have a.
Um.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:24
Why the download was was too big?

James Maki   7:27
Tell him it was identified by us. We we already knew about it.
Like the the dev team was like the dev team is the one that paused it like like we did that intentionally.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   7:34
Mm-hmm.

James Maki   7:49
Yeah, just let's just tell them that like the the dev team posited while they were investigating like a a a potential issue.
It was restarted as soon as they completed their work.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:01
2.

James Maki   8:23
Yeah, I guess.
Like like the issue was the issue was identified by us prior to your tickets.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:38
The issues.

James Maki   8:40
Identified by us prior to your ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   9:13
OK.

James Maki   9:17
The the issue was identified prior to it, like we already knew about it, not data files identified.
Like she, she said. Like, oh, like why it wasn't restarted or identified by you, that it was paused. Like it was. We did it. Yeah, yeah, that's right. There you go.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   9:44
Need to keep it in pending.

James Maki   9:46
Yeah, like, I don't know if you guys need to start talking to Sigar about this kind of thing. Like you guys need to decide like how you're gonna respond to this kind of stuff cause I'm only here for another month, right? Like I can't. I'm not gonna be able to tell you guys after I'm gone. I'm not gonna be able to tell you how to respond. You guys have to be able to figure this out without me.
So like, if you need to talk to Cigar or someone else like to come up with answers, then you guys need to start doing that. And you guys need to start doing that like before me telling you like we're getting to that point, guys. Like you guys actually need to start owning this stuff, not just waiting for me to.
To give you an answer, OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   10:24
Yes.

James Maki   10:30
Alright, yeah, so let's let's say that for now. And I don't know, she's probably still not gonna be happy with that. Like I know her. She's probably still gonna come back and and want more.
Oh, what's that Step 3 file ticket?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   10:48
It has been resolved.

James Maki   10:50
Oh, perfect.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   11:28
Oh, so they're asking to set up AUD receipts.
So this is what you are expected, right? Like they will ask this.

James Maki   11:46
Yes.
Is there a cost associated with it? I don't think so.
But I'm also not an expert in the contracts.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   12:37
OK.

James Maki   12:37
All right. I mean, so we can, we can turn it on for him. I mean, that's easy. I don't.
I don't think there's a cost.
Are you asking me out there?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   13:06
Shall we turn it or we need to ask someone?

James Maki   13:11
I'm asking Amanda.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   13:18
So shall we reply to interns?

James Maki   13:28
I just messaged her in the chat, so we'll wait and see what she says.
While we wait on her, yeah, while we wait on her, is there another ticket?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   13:57
OK.

James Maki   14:12
I will have to switch.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:13
We will check for a hundred till then.

James Maki   14:17
OK.
Alright, what's going on with the PDQ? Are we still having trouble connecting to their FTP?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:25
Yes, James.

James Maki   14:26
OK, all right, we all right. This needs this needs to be escalated at this point. Like we need to do something like this has been going on for how long? The like that like we're not getting our files like something actually needs to be done about this. So we don't have access to the firewall anymore. So as far as like testing the connection and like and all that stuff, like all we really know is that we can't get to it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   14:27
Oh.

James Maki   14:45
So at this point, and she's arguing with us, right? It didn't work. It's because they didn't put in the port number.
All right, OK.
All right. How did we?
Someone was doing something with Barclays.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   15:24
It.

James Maki   15:29
Alright, how do we do that? Tell that command.
There we go.
All right, so they're saying we need to with support number.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   15:48
Mm.

James Maki   16:35
Alright, and what port did they want us to use?
Is it in the ticket? Or should you scroll up a little bit? Is it just port 22? Did it say?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   16:52
Where James?
So in the server.

James Maki   16:57
Did did somewhere in this ticket, did they tell us what port number to use? Like when they told us to do the telnet command, did they tell us what port number to use?
All right, you're not. You're not looking.
So their answer is the reason the telnet the telnet didn't work is because they didn't put in the port number. Did they tell us what port number to use? Is it somewhere in the ticket? If you scroll up, look through their look through the history.
Did they tell us what port to use?
Keep going.
It doesn't know. It doesn't know.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   17:46
I don't think so. They have given us number. Oh.

James Maki   18:00
Alright, alright. Well that was that's us connecting to them. That was us telling them that like that's your message.
All right, so it doesn't look like they did. All right. I mean, it's an FTP connection, so I'm assuming it's port 22.
Alright, we're just gonna do that.
All right, and that did not work.
I don't know how to spell. OK, hold on.
OK.
Alright, are you on the Web 01 server?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   19:03
Yes.

James Maki   19:06
OK, alright, go over to their their directory.
And here is the command I just dropped in the chat for you on how to do the telnet.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   19:35
Direct this one or before this.

James Maki   19:41
Yeah, right. So, so that's doing the telnet command is what that's doing and that's their IP address and it's just space and then the port number. And I'm assuming since they didn't tell us, I'm assuming they just want us to use the the default FTP port which is 22.
Uh, so yeah, so that's what I did. So hit enter. You can run that.
And then the results that you get, uh, that's what we're gonna send to her.
So I I would copy.
Like copy the whole thing from like from where from where you sent the command. We're gonna send her the results.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   20:29
Mm.

James Maki   20:30
At this point we need to get this.
So I don't know if you just wanna like CC one of them on onto the ticket.
Like that's that's what I would do like and tell her that we're adding like one of our networking guys.
But yeah, but at this point, like like we need to get them talking like this needs to get figured out 'cause it's.
Like we're not getting any other files. This has been going on for for a whole week now that they're essentially behind, right? So that's that's not good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   21:01
Yes.
Hey.
Shall I raise a dev task or we need to keep someone in CC?

James Maki   21:13
I I would see season one on the ticket now to try to escalate it as quickly as possible. Like I feel like it's at that point. Something needs to be done. Someone needs to figure this out and it's not gonna be us since we don't have firewall access.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   21:22
Good.

James Maki   21:30
Unfortunately.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   21:31
Thanks.

James Maki   21:33
So I don't know if you need to put like like Cameron or Tarun or I don't know someone someone from the from the Cato group.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   21:45
Kamran.

James Maki   21:45
Or maybe or or maybe maybe send them a message 1st and ask them.
I tell them that maybe that's better. Actually, maybe let's let's talk to them first.
I don't know, like like send them a message, tell them what's going on.
And that you need help figuring it out and and then let them tell you who uh who to add.
That's probably a better way to go about it instead of just picking someone at random.
All right. And then I do have another call with Sagar that I need to switch over to in just a minute. But so Amanda did respond on the AAD receipts. There is not a cost, so we can turn that on in the additional settings.
Like just go look at their company and like you'll see response receipts is already turned on. So you're just gonna do the exact same thing for AD receipts.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:53
That's probably it does.

James Maki   22:54
That was the Genesis one, Columbia.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:59
Hey.

James Maki   23:18
Yeah. So like responses just turned on. So you just need to do the same thing for AUD receipts and that's all and that's all you have to do to turn it on form. And then as Amanda said, there's not a cost associated.
Yeah, so that should answer both of his questions.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   23:35
This one.

James Maki   0:04
And so I'm showing that the emails have been delivered.

Manjunath S started transcription

James Maki   0:15
If you want, since it's, since it's should my. If you if you look at her most recent e-mail.
So one from yesterday.
So if you look at the password reset from that, actually look at the e-mail the the password will be in there. So if you want to just copy it from there and just send it to her like in teams or something, might make it a little bit easier and.
Get her. Get her logged down.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   0:56
Do we have her password?

James Maki   1:02
Yeah, it's in a. You can get it out of postmark.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:14
Mm hmm mm hmm.

James Maki   1:15
Come on, share my screen. So yeah. So if you just look up her e-mail.
I'd just her most recent.
The most recent reset you can get the password from there and just send it to her.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:29
So put it in chat, James, I will send her.

James Maki   1:57
Alright. Whether any other any follow-ups on any of the other tickets that we talked about earlier, anything else?
Any replies or anything that we can?
If I if there's anything I know there was a few that we sent out some replies on and uh, we said like if they didn't respond by the end of the day, go ahead and close it. Uh, if you if you have any of those, go ahead and go ahead and solve them.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:08
I think it's.
I don't have some.

James Maki   2:23
And therefore OK.
Yeah. Perfect.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   2:54
What this song means, she had replied.
That's saved for Euless.

James Maki   3:03
OK so.
Uh, huh. That's still not very clear. I'm assuming that she's talking about the receipts.
OK, alright, 2225.
This week, yeah, account number loan ID.
At eight. Oh, man, I swear you people.
Swear to God.
They really just want us to do absolutely every single link for them.
No, I'm not showing.
I'm not showing a custom format for them.
Is she just making that up?
I don't understand why do we not have.
Lock file.
That does not make sense.
Alright, that doesn't make any sense. How did this happen?
So apparently we don't have log files for American Airlines. It looks like they.
Or not added.
And the repo.
Which doesn't make sense.
How did that get missed?
But they're in the get ignore.
Why are they not?
Up to they have their own.
Yeah.
Well, the first thing is, like, she's asking us to.
This is so ridiculous.
I don't. I don't understand how this could possibly just quit working. That doesn't make sense. Like what?
What the hell happened here?
Alright, so she is. She's talking about the receipts.
So over on the server looks like the AUD receipts are being like a by by default they're labelled as AED receipts like they start with AUD, underscore and then it has like the account number and then whatever else after that.
But so it looks like in the move images repo.
Share my screen.
So here in the move images repo.
We have a custom script for them.
Or move a a credit union.
And so if looking in there, I found this part here about like the receipt where it's supposed to be.
And it looks like it's supposed to be cleaning the filename and removing AUD underscore.
With just the cleaned filename.
And so here is like the current receipts on the server. You see how they all start with AUD, underscore, so that's what she's basically asking us to remove.
Umm.
You so try and I was gonna try and verify that like the past files were being sent that way.
So from here I went to.
On it logs. Oh, so this is on on the web 01 server.
So this is where we have like all of our images logs and there should be one here for every company that we're.
Uh getting files or getting image files for which is literally every company? Umm, but.
A credit union is not in here.
And so it looks like it's because they have this custom script, so they're not in this script, which is the normal move images.
Which I think they still need to be here.
Is this is the script that creates our log file.
So here's the sonnet images. What logs?
Oh, actually, all right, this is on web 02.
Yeah, I'm not totally sure. So this is another one that I want to talk.
This is another one I want to discuss on a Level 3 call.
Or we can get clarification on what exactly needs to be done.
Alright.
Actually, maybe I should make it up.
I'm sorry to make a task for this. Is that a better way to go about it?
Oh yeah. OK.
All right, let me just put that note on there for now.
If I if you want to reply to her, you can tell her like we're gonna have the Dev team review the the file naming.
But that's about all we can say for the moment.
So can either do that or wait till Monday. We should have a a better response for her.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   15:54
Or should I reply it on Monday?

James Maki   16:01
Yeah, you can wait till then. That's fine.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   16:10
So this one.
The user word which I have sent is not able to open.

James Maki   16:22
If you have trouble logging in.
Like else, Jess has not able to open. I'm assuming she needs like a password reset. If you click on her name.
And go to the security side.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   16:43
I know James and the students.
Not for reset password. We have sent them the user guide PDF no.

James Maki   16:49
Should she is trying to open up the attachment, the attachment is gonna make her log in in order to download it. Like in order to view it. It's gonna make her log into Zendesk in order to get to it. So she needs her password reset, so she needs her password reset for Zendesk so she can get to the attachment.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   17:01
Mm hmm.

James Maki   17:07
So we're send her a password. I know. She's not saying that, but that's the only thing that could possibly be the issue. Like I I know she's not giving you any details.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   17:07
OK.

James Maki   17:18
It like that's the only.
Yeah, but that's the only thing it could be. So let's send her a password reset. So I click on her name.
Not insights on it. This is not a sonnet reset. This is a Zendesk reset.
So click on her name and go to security settings.
Up up in the middle security settings.
In the middle.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   17:44
Page.

James Maki   17:46
Right there. Yep. Centre reset.
And then we and then we're gonna respond on the ticket and let her know that we sent her a password reset for Zendesk.
And and and you could just ask her like, or tell her. Let us know if that resolves the issue or let us know if you still have trouble after that.
I feel pretty confident that that's her issue and she should be good after this.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   18:45
And I put it on pendant.

James Maki   18:48
Yeah, put it up in for now. And then 'cause, we need her to verify that she can get to it now, and hopefully she's gonna say yes, that worked and we can close the ticket.
Oh yeah, that block notification one we were looking at that earlier.
What did happen with that?
I think there might be a problem with their notification download 'cause they have one scheduled.
So if you go to their block notifications.
And what side?
Go to the very end of them to the last page.
Do I Scroll down? Yeah.
Go to, go to the variant, go to the 31.
Yeah.
Create it on OK, all right. And those still say.
Like 521, OK.
So it does look like we are not getting.
That they're new block notifications.
All right. I mean for download issues, that's not really something that we're gonna be able to troubleshoot either.
Yeah, dude, like we really just can't catch a break here.
Oh, OK. All right. How do we get to this screen?
So the download has the the one that you scheduled earlier. That download still has not started.
So I have no idea why. How do we get to this screen?
So look, I just scheduled a new one and it took me to the sonnet notification job. Oh, is that it? OK.
OK, great. OK. So if you go back over to the admin side.
And over on the the dashboard menu to get to the notifications.
Yeah, like the, uh, same place that we ran that download earlier, yeah.
If you go to the the jobs.
Alright, so that first one there, that's the one that you ran earlier today and then the one above it, that's the one that I just tried to start, so.
That download is not starting.
So I mean that may explain.
Kinda what's going on here.
'Cause in the in the notifications in the schedule jobs, hpcr's does have one set to download at 4:00 AM, so that that's supposed to be running every day, and so for some reason it's not.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   23:36
So do we need to raise a dev tasks for this as it?

James Maki   23:42
Yeah, yeah, we need the devs to look. I'm not even gonna raise the task, so I'm just gonna put it in the chat because.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   23:45
Yeah.

James Maki   24:24
No, I'm. I'm sending a message on that. You're at.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   24:28
Out.

James Maki   26:05
Alright, what's up? Oh, it's the cqa.
I did see that earlier. What's going on there?
API is not responding in CK region or is it 401 error?
We need a new business token.
All right. I mean, the token's easy enough.
I don't know what that means, Lydia.
We'll check if RPA 01 has the Cron working.
Row. Are you serious?
I want.
OK, I don't know where.
I don't know where the crown jobs.
List of athletic.
Images are still a problem, but download will work.
Oh my God, it just never ends.
I don't know where to go, buddy. Where?
Probably download. Let's go there.
As soon as I might be a good spot.
You have cron's do have crons, OK.
And this can't be right.
Oh my God, dude.
Like, how are they still giving me new things to do?
I'm supposed to be.
On my way out.
Where does that?
I see now.
He absolutely.
Said RPA, 01.
And his initial response?
And now he's all like, oh, I'm at RBA O2. That's where it runs. Ha ha ha.
Psych.
OK.
Right, so I must have been *** **** it.
It was right the first time. I think it was RPA 01.
So I do not see notifications.
I'll show my screen so you guys can look with me.
I've never done this before, by the way, I'm just figuring this stuff out right now on the call. Just looking so.
Take you along for the ride.
Right, so I'm currently on.
RPA O2 in the slash sonnet slash download folder.
So Cron jobs run on E Cron tab. So to view the Cron tab it's just Cron tab space dash L.
Uh, so that lists out the contents of the tab. If you wanna make changes.
I would use crontab dash E to edit.
Yeah, but so these are all like the scheduled jobs that are running.
From this location on the RPA O2 server.
So we have stuff here for the user action log, so that's the actions that users are taking inside of sonnet. So this is like what you see in the account history. That's what these tasks are related to.
So do they do have everything labelled pretty well, so that's good. So here's attachments and images.
So this is all the different.
Animations that we have for moving.
Move in the images after they've been downloaded, move in the metre to the API or FTP servers. That's what all these different commands are.
And then we have AE, DS and some A/C DVS. So regular dispute stuff. So regular downloads, receipts.
And a reconciliation process that we don't use anymore.
So that's all that's on RPA O2. So it looks like he was actually correct the first time.
And you do have to pseudo into the sonnet user in order to view, because they do run under like the Cron jobs run under a user profile. So if you're.
If you're not acting as that user, like if you look at your own Cron jobs like, you won't see anything. They all they all run under the sonnet user.
Right. So I'm gonna go back to RPA 01.
'Cause it looked like that was actually correct.
Alright, so go back to the Sonic download.
So it's on it, and Crumb, tab, dash L.
Right. So most of this is the same. This is the one that's different. So here is the notifications.
And so it looks like this is the correct place that it runs because it was not listed in RPA O2.
So to edit this, we're going to do Cron tab dash E.
And you we use the Chron tabs, we use that quite a bit for the the dev disputes.
So when we do actually finally get time to focus on that, like I've been trying to do all week.
You guys will get some more experience with that. Wow. Which will be really helpful.
Right. So I'm going to.
Select in the crowd in the crowds, the.
The pound sign here. That's the that's the comment.
Simple. So if so, any line that has the pound sign in front of it that's commented out and so that's why this drop has not been running. It's because this was commented out and that's how they turned it off, right? So I just took out the pound sign. So just like whenever we're editing a text file on one of the links servers, when you're done.
With escape.
Escape would Take Me Out of that, but it didn't.
I told you.
Oh, X oh boy.
Cancel.
All right, I think I messed up this up. Oh boy.
How do I get out of?
Set.
How do I exit? I don't understand how it wants me.
To modify buffer, let's say no.
Modification rate. OK, good.
All right, let's try that again.
I'm gonna say yes to start. Oh, boy. Oh, *** **** you.
All right, so this actually works a little bit differently than what I'm used to and.
I'm not quite sure.
I don't think I feel comfortable. I'm trying to edit this.
I feel like I'm about to break something.
Run job A/C copy thumbnails.
Don't see BC copies thumbnails.
Right here.
Are you saying that needs to be stopped?
And it might have lost lady.
None.
Alright, well, at this point we're just waiting for Liddy to respond.
So.
Anyway.
Let's look back at this what was going on here again?
Oh yeah, possibly a new token.
So I was on the 11th.
So a 401 error.
I believe is an unauthorised error, so it's basically a login issue. Is what that is, what that should be if I if I remember right?
Actually I wonder if you can just Google that real fast.
Yeah, unauthorised. OK.
So yeah, token token's possible could be the issue.
So M&T has two branches. They have mortgage and retail. I believe mortgage is what they typically use.
Did they put the token in?
Good. All right. So there's their token right there.
OK, so 3.
The FGB OK, that is the wrong token.
I wonder if that's there.
Yep, that's their production token. So yeah, that would explain their issue.
So who's sapria? You sent this to him if you.
I'll let you share screen again if you go into the cqa environment.
We're just gonna copy their token for them and send it.
'Cause. Yeah, it looks like they're trying to use their production token in cqa.
And that would definitely result in a login issue.
Just copy that token. Don't. Yeah. Careful not to hit the.
Oh, you did hit it. Did you hit it?
I mean, I guess it doesn't matter if they didn't have it anyway, but OK, no, you're fine.
I think if you if you click the the little circle thing next to it, I think that generates a new token. So we used to have that kinda like greyed out so you couldn't do it by accident. But I think it's kind of open now. And for a second I thought you would have clicked on it, but you're fine, you're good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   46:23
OK.

James Maki   46:27
Yeah. So I would tell him.
It looks like you're using the production token in your screenshot. Here is the CQA token.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:06
OK.

James Maki   47:08
Yeah, Yep, looks good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:15
Category.

James Maki   47:17
Do we have a CQA category?
Yeah. There you go. Yeah, she's that.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:25
I put it on pending or salt.

James Maki   47:29
I would put it on pending until they confirm that they've that that's resolved the issue.
But I'm looking at the screenshot, it looks like that's all it was though.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:43
OK. OK. James, I don't have any more tickets.

James Maki   47:49
Last one alright.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   47:50
I'm done with my. Oh, this one is the same. Let that be.
There is not.

James Maki   48:05
Oh, yeah, yeah. What's the? Yeah, the emails.
Uh.
Let me just look inside postmark again real fast and just see what her activity has been for today.
Alright. Yeah, it looks like she hasn't logged in since this morning.
Do do you? Do you want me to respond? Since she's, like, being kind of combative.
All right. Yeah. So like.
Alright, I see. Like there wasn't another update sent here.
That didn't she have a?
Yeah. Tell you what, I'm just gonna respond.
Alright, there you go.
And I put myself as follower. So if she, uh, if she responds again.
I'll. I'll get in front of it.
Alright guys, if that's it, I'll let you go. Enjoy your weekend.
Thanks for all your time and all your work I know.
Tickets are still a little high, right? Yeah. Tickets still a little high right now, but we're making progress. We're 130 now, so that's actually pretty good from where we were this morning.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   52:11
Thank you, James.

James Maki   52:23
So all right.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   52:25
We can. Bye bye.

James Maki   52:28
Bye.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri started transcription

James Maki   0:04
Did you run the the command to fix the card IDs on web O2 on the server?

Manjunath S   0:09
It will go to server, right? Yeah.

James Maki   0:09
you on the server.
Uh.

Manjunath S   0:12
Yeah.

James Maki   0:14
Alright, so you did that and then you reprocessed the Step 2 files.

Manjunath S   0:18
Steptofiles.
Thanks.
I just saw the comment butter in reposses disturbed files.

James Maki   0:47
OK.

Manjunath S   0:48
Oh, web portal server, right?

James Maki   0:51
The web O2 server is where you run the card ID fix and then but then process the files on web O1.

Manjunath S   0:54
Yeah.
And.
PHP artition, common gems.

James Maki   2:27
Uh.
I guess, but you're not in the right folder.
And so if you like I.
Uh, you didn't have the uh.

Manjunath S   2:49
I have permission denied.

James Maki   2:51
Yeah, well that that folder doesn't exist, so it's. I think it's go to Sonic user 1st and and then list it out. OK, I think the name of the folder is slightly different than that.
Yeah, CD.
Uh yeah, uh, slash on it slash user.
There and then list it out.
Sonnet at Pans is the name of it.
Uh, so you just said the name part wrong.

Manjunath S   3:41
Yeah, I just did it.

James Maki   3:43
Yeah, no. Now you can run the the artisan command.

Manjunath S   3:44
Hello.
OK.

James Maki   4:13
Oh, yes.
Oh, in front of new redo the it's supposed to be a dash, dash. I think the way that he put it there. I think he had it wrong.
Yeah, in a in front of new, yeah, delete the.
No eyes.

Manjunath S   4:38
This one.

James Maki   4:38
Yeah, yeah, delete that and put a put a dash, dash.
And then and then take out the the middle dash, dash.
Yeah, I'll write it.
There we go.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   5:10
Oh, James, when we have to use this soon.

James Maki   5:14
Well, right now, honestly, you should be running it every morning until until the dev team fixes this and puts a fix in so we don't have to. Right now we have to do it manually.

Manjunath S   5:35
Exiting from our to Sabha.

James Maki   5:38
Yeah, you can exit off this server now and go over to the web 01.
Right, so the Step 2 files are already in the process folder, so let's move them back.
To the root and then you can.
Rocess them again.
Yeah, you might as well just move all of them. Well, well, yeah, or at least move.
Yeah, I guess just move the 20, the six of 16 ones. So if you do MV.
Space. Yeah, yeah, just copy that first part of the date.
No, just copy the first part like up to the the 0616.
So it's year, month, day, just copy up that far.
No, in in the file name you you were in the right spot.
Yeah, in the 16. There you go. Yeah, copy that and then you can paste that in and put a star and that'll move all the step 2 files from today. It'll move just those to the the next folder. So now do your space dot dot slash.
There they go.

Manjunath S   8:03
What a source on it.

James Maki   8:04
Oh, oh, yeah. I mean, we do that every single time. It's so funny.

Manjunath S   8:10
Keep.
Hello.

James Maki   8:22
Uh.
If you want, if you want to see what's what's still in there.
All right, so you so you moved today's step 2 files back up to the root directory. So now over in the UI.
Uh, you can read in their files.
There we go.
And this time and this time we should get get some more accounts loaded.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   8:52
Oops.

James Maki   8:57
Yeah, so you can just click the top one and it'll load all three.
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   9:02
Jim, what if we have the pull option in this dashboard? So we can just pull it or first we need to move the...

James Maki   9:10
So that's polling. Polling is when you need to retrieve a file from the client's FTP. So if if the file is on their server, then yes, you have to pull it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   9:25
So if that OK, OK, got it. So after that there is no need of for reprocessing the step two file, right?

James Maki   9:33
Well, that's what we're doing right now. We're processing it right now.
That's that's what he just did by hitting that button to process Step 2.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   9:43
Look.

James Maki   9:55
So since there was three files there, it might take a minute, but it shouldn't take too long.
Great. How many were there on the dashboard?

Manjunath S   10:52
36.
The three in now.

James Maki   11:39
Alright, so it doesn't seem.
To actually be loading anything. Oh, never mind. I'm wrong. So the number's dropping. There we go. OK, that's good.

Manjunath S   11:50
Yeah.

James Maki   11:58
OK. Yeah, that's great. OK. So these guys have been testing. So there's still five there and that's because these guys have been doing some testing with direct and that's what those five are.
So you don't have to worry about those, but so good. So it looks like those that are 18, those should be in the roles engine queue now since they're no longer in the step one queue.
So as soon as this process, we should be good to go.

Manjunath S   12:35
Yeah, Step 2 is being processed.

James Maki   12:37
Yeah.
All right. And then I remember we were.
But we were trying to get.

Manjunath S   12:49
Yeah, it's 0, James.

James Maki   12:55
0 Wayne Perfect. All right, that's exactly what you want to see.

Manjunath S   13:05
So that's it, right?

James Maki   13:06
All right, I that is it for that ticket. So these guys were having an issue last week. If you remember with a if you look at their to speak queue, they have some that are missing SOR data.

Manjunath S   13:25
Yeah.

James Maki   13:25
And so we were trying to get that last week, remember. So I think we had sent like some new step one files and like we didn't like a whole bunch of stuff, right? Yes. All right. So it looks like we still haven't got that data.

Manjunath S   13:33
Oh.

James Maki   13:45
Uh, so I want to try and check one of the files and see if it's there.
Right, so last time we sent it, looks like it was.
1240 on June 12th.
O if we look inside this file.
Do we have this account?
Yes, we do.
Although that is a.
Checked up looking name OK.
OK, if you would return to disk queue.
All right, back on the server, let's move.
Yeah, so let's do the same thing that we did before. This time, instead of moving the 616 files, let's move the 612 files.
Uh, move those back.
Yeah, it moves us to the root.

Manjunath S   15:44
Oh, sorry, James. I was on mute this file.

James Maki   15:48
Yeah, move the yeah, all the 612 files.
Uh, Yep, Yep.

Manjunath S   16:16
Right.

James Maki   16:27
Right. And wait just one. Wait just one second. Let me.
We read my query.
OK, alright, process file.
I'll just, I'll just start to now, yeah.
Cool.
Alright.
So there's only nine that are missing data, and so it should be in these in those 612 files, so hopefully we can.
Fix these and finally be done.
With United Auto.

Manjunath S   17:28
Yeah, I think it's gone.
I think it's wrong.

James Maki   17:53
OK.
No, they're still waiting for data now, so I set them. I set them back to new status so they're not the queue.

Manjunath S   18:32
In this query.

James Maki   18:40
No.
No, I I already did it. I did it before you process the files.

Manjunath S   18:47
OK.

James Maki   18:56
I'm just watching the I'm just watching the dashboard now trying to see if these.
These nine move out.
Like they're supposed to.
All right, I'm not sure why.
Those are not loading.
The file is done processing.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   20:09
ohh James for true accord and southern Oregon. So for those also they are not valid disputes.

James Maki   20:18
OK, all right, so so same thing. Try and process their files from today.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   20:26
Yes, I did, but also they are not loading.

James Maki   20:28
Right then.

Manjunath S   20:56
So James have to deactivate this company.

James Maki   21:13
Um.
Yeah, so disabling a company is really easy. We've we've done that before.
Um.
Uh, over on the company page.
Insights on it.
I think your screen might be frozen. It looks like I'm still looking at Zendesk. It looks like your cursor is not blinking anymore.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:05
No, James's power has cracked.
I get lost to.

James Maki   22:09
Oh, OK.
Oh, OK, gotcha.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:13
OK, uh, let me take up history.

James Maki   22:16
Mhm.
Or.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:23
So this one only since from morning I'm trying to pull this step too.

James Maki   22:32
OK, there's a the the step one file did get sent right? It's not on our server. Uh, Scroll down.
OK, good. Yeah. So it's not the files waiting, yeah.
So when when this gets done, we should have theirs to should have their step two file.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   22:55
First we need to push step one and then pull up the step.

James Maki   22:58
No, it looks like it's already been sent. If it if it was still on our server, you would see it in that files waiting section. And the fact that it's not there means that it should have been sent, so they should have that. So yeah, so now the next step is to get their Step 2.
So if when that completes, if we still do not have their Step 2 file.
Then that might be. The answer to her question is why she doesn't have disputes.
We can, uh.
Uh, we can also go look on their server just to see what's there.
Have you got your? Have you got your repos?
Access fixed.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   23:56
Oh, no, James. Actually, one time I got means it came and again I have lost that.
So for the first time Emery has resolved it and day before yesterday I was on Friday I was checking with that.

James Maki   24:05
OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   24:14
So it was working, but today again it was not working. Need to check again.
Don't know what's happening with that.

James Maki   24:24
OK.
Uh, yeah, that's uh.
Yeah, if you don't have that, that really kind of limits you. Um.
For FTP stuff.
Sir, Vaughn, how about you over in in Azure, are you able to get to the repos section?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   24:57
Sorry, now, James.

James Maki   24:59
Uh, asking Sarah Vaughn.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:04
Oh no, actually it was working on Friday, right? So I haven't asked him. So tomorrow once he comes back, I will ask him.

James Maki   25:13
OK, yeah, but I'm I'm asking Sarah Vaughn now if like if he has access to rebos.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:18
Saravana.
Uh, I don't think so. He has Sharma. Do you have access for repos?
Hello.

James Maki   25:38
Mhm.
You there, Sarah Vaughn?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:46
I wanna.

James Maki   25:47
Uh.
Maybe you stepped away for a minute.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   25:52
Hmm.

James Maki   25:52
OK.

Saravanabhavan S   25:54
Just, just, just, I'm, I'm audible now.

James Maki   25:57
Oh, there he is.
Yep.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   26:00
Yes. So do you have access for Dev Azuri?

Saravanabhavan S   26:02
Uh.
Yes, I have access. No, I don't think. I didn't work on the repros, but I have access for dev I sure.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   26:07
For repose.

James Maki   26:21
Alright, but you don't have the repos section.

Saravanabhavan S   26:25
No, I I I think don't know.

James Maki   26:29
OK.
All right, well, Sabrina, whenever you talk to someone next about yours, probably be a good idea to ask about Servon. Also, make sure that both of you guys get. Yeah, make sure both of you guys get access.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   26:48
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I will look into yourself.

James Maki   26:54
OK. Thank you.
Right.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   27:01
So for this Step 2 has not.
On the side word.
So we need to pull out from there, right?
Or else we need to.

James Maki   27:15
Yeah, so, all right, so we're still not getting their file. OK, all right, so let me let me check their server real fast and just see what's on there.
See if uh the step one file is still there.
Or if they've done anything.
All right, I'm on their server.
I see the step one file is in their incoming folder.
And there is no step two file. OK, I love it when they blame us for stuff and they're the ones that aren't doing their job. But OK, all right, so the step one file is on their server, so they have not processed it yet.
So the step two file is not available so on the ticket.
Let's ask her.
Or let's tell her. Yeah, this is on the the Oregon one, yeah.
Let's tell her.
We have verified the step one file has been uploaded to you.
Please process it and let us know when the step two is available.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   29:25
All step on file.

James Maki   29:27
Yeah, verify that the step one file has been uploaded to you.
Please process and let us know when the step two file is available.
And so when she tells you that step that the file is available, then you can use that button to pull to step two and you should be able to get it this time or the next time.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   29:55
OK.
The for true accord.

James Maki   30:23
Yeah, here, hold on one second. Actually, before we move on, let me let me show you guys what I did just so you can, so we have it in the video and and you guys have the instructions. All right, so this was.
How I verified they had the file, so I'm in their folder on the web O1 server and so credit.
This is the script for their file push for the step one, so copy the SFTP command through to the URL.
That's what I'm gonna use here to connect.
Sudo sue went to Sonnet first whenever you're testing FTP connection use Sony user and then I have the password copied which is that.
So I'm gonna paste it in and now I'm connected to their FTP server.
So LS to list all contents on the client server. They do have a sonnet directory, so it went there first and then they have incoming and outgoing folders.
So I looked at the incoming.
And there is today's step one file.
So that's how we verified that it's still pending and that they need to process it.
And that's it. So then by to disconnect.
All right.
Uh, just wanna make sure I showed you guys just.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   32:13
Yeah.

James Maki   32:15
Refresher. All right, next ticket.
Oh, I was gonna try look more into the ERC or.
Actually, let's focus on United Auto since.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   32:53
Mhm.
It was actually 69 but it came to 23 now.

James Maki   33:00
OK, so you did get a few more loaded. OK, alright, that's good.
OK, so they still have more, uh, that are in new status then?
If you go to the the look ahead calendar.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   33:17
This one also the count has been changed. Step 2. So again.

James Maki   33:21
Yes, yes. So anytime that you reload a Step 2 file, it is going to add the number of records to the file count.
So each time you reprocess a step two file, that count's gonna go up.
And yeah, so that can get. If you've had to reload a file a few times, it can get kind of a like that's not very helpful anymore, right?
Um, but yeah, like any uh.
So like if a if a dispute's already active, but like it's it reloads that data, it'll like it gets added again.
Um.
All right, so we do also have their step two file from Friday. Did you did you reprocess just the one from today or did you also do the 613 file?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:21
Just the 613.
Sit 16.

James Maki   34:27
Oh, yeah, OK.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:29
OK.

James Maki   34:34
Thank you. Oh.
OK. Oh, that was the SO credit. OK, let's see.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   34:50
Oh, do I need to do this one as well? 13th.

James Maki   34:53
Yeah, yeah. If you if you didn't do it before, yeah, let's go ahead and do that one also.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   35:00
OK.

James Maki   35:01
Uh, you're already you're already pseudoed into us on it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   35:11
Yeah.

James Maki   35:11
Yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   35:24
So deactivate the company.

James Maki   35:35
Uh, yeah, so the the deactivations.
Uh, for a sonnet. Uh is super easy.
Um.
Yeah.
Yeah. So we'll go over, yeah, we'll go over to the to that company.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   36:12
Mhm. Admin side.

James Maki   36:14
OK, Yep.
And let's let's look at their users tab real quick. I just want to see the last time that they were in Sonnet.
They were in there today.
OK.
Alright, uh, let's go back over to the UI side. Uh, visit and sign it.
I want to see if they completed some disputes today, so let's look at the dispute section.
It did complete one.
In the dashboard is there is that in the in the step 3 queue?
Just go to the dashboard.
Yes, OK.
OK, what was that ticket number again?
860.
OK, since they have some activity there, I'm gonna message Amanda real fast in the support.
Uh, chat.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   38:07
Uh, pot gems.

James Maki   38:12
I'm messaging Amanda in the support chat real fast just to verify that she wants us to close this down or like or or deactivate them.
OK.
All right, so yeah, I just want to double check just since they had the user activity. I want to double check that we should deactivate these guys now. I don't want, I don't want to get yelled at again. Like I want to Shimai got bad at us for the LJ Ross one.
Yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   39:17
Yes, please.

James Maki   39:18
OK.
All right.
OK, let's.
I'm gonna go ahead and make their step three file.
I'm doing it right now.
And.
Oh, let's see. Do these guys, right? It looks like we're hosting for these guys, right?
That's what it looks like.
Alright, so she said we can go ahead and do this for USCB, so.
All right, looks like the file has been created.
OK.
All right, let's also check Rev solve.
As well, yeah, the other company.
Oh, looks like they have not.
OK, alright, nothing there in their queue.
Uh uh, check their user activity real fast.
Uh, nothing. OK, cool.
All right. That's like really old. All right. That's kind of weird.
OK, alright, let's start with these guys.
Uh.
Yep, so first we need to know just what kind of client they are. So it looks like this one. If you go back to the if you go to the edit company tab and then check the additional settings.
All right, so these guys, they're not, they're not API, they don't have a token. So we just want to, we just want to double check what type of client they are before we do this because it's going to wipe out all of their actions. So we just want to make sure that we get all the back end stuff.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   42:49
Oh.

James Maki   43:05
So we need to know what type of client they are, like what type of data exchange they use, if it's FTP, if it is FTP, who's hosting or their API because we do want to, we will have to go through and like delete their folders off of the servers.
So you wanna know which servers to go to and all that. Uh. So if you look at the additional settings, uh, these guys do have.
The push and pull turned on, so that means that the client was hosting the FTP. So that means that they are going to have scripts inside of the data files repo that need to be deleted.
So that's that's really all you're checking for is just to just to make sure what type of client it is so that you know, so that you know what repos they need to be removed from and what scripts to take them out of.
All right, all right. So so these guys are a client hosted FTB. So now we know that we're good to proceed. So you can go back to the general section.
And we are going to enter in a termination date for today.
Or actually, let's use the the date in the ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   44:27
Yes, she gave the date.

James Maki   44:30
Yeah, so let's use that date.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   44:32
4:30.

James Maki   44:44
All right. And then we're gonna turn off is active and when you do this.
When you save this, it's going to clear out. It's going to do pretty much all the work for you inside of Sonnet. It's going to do most of it. So it's going to disable the users. It's going to delete or turned off scheduled actions. It's going to do a whole bunch of things. So don't do this unless you mean to do it.
Uh, so let's save this. Yep, save changes.
All right, and now if you scroll back up, it should have turned off.
OK, not here. All right. If you go to the users, everyone, all of them should be disabled now. I think they pretty much already were. Yeah, so permissions are removed, all that stuff.
The schedules. Check the schedules tab. See if they've.
I can't remember if they just get disabled or if they get deleted. OK, they're just disabled. OK, great. OK, so that's good. So this will also tell you.
Like what scripts that need to be removed from it all and all that stuff too. So all right, great. So you can go ahead and you can remove the scheduled download.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   46:13
This one.

James Maki   46:14
Uh, Yep.
OK, oh, that's kind of annoying. It takes you to the.
OK, it took you to the scheduled downloads screen. OK, let's go back to the company. Go back to organizations.
Uh, it was a Revsolve who we were on.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   46:46
Yeah.

James Maki   46:46
Yeah, so it doesn't let you select it now that it's disabled. That's that's also annoying if you do a do a control F.
And and just search for it normally.
And I look for myself.
Uh, click out of the the.
There you go there.
No, now you should click on it. Go back.
There, if you click on it, it should let you in.
Yeah, so it just for whatever reason that filter.
At the top of the organization, saying is just a.
Yeah, like it grays out the disabled clients. That's annoying. OK, but OK, all right, so you don't have the data files repo, so you can't do that part of it.
But once the one of the next steps would also be to remove their folders off of the servers.
So you want to take them off. You're you're basically just undoing everything that you do in a setup, right? You're just kind of working backwards. So you want to take them off like I remove them from the RPA O2 server.
And the web O1 server.
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you're good.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   48:33
RP.

James Maki   48:35
Yes, RPA 02. Yeah. Or actually, I think we need to do both. Is there two? Yeah, there is there. Yeah, we need to do. We need to do both, actually. So it doesn't matter what you what we do first. Yeah, we can do this one. RPA 02. Let's do it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   49:04
OK.

James Maki   49:05
All right, it's like I said. So we're basically just undoing everything that you do in a setup. So this is one of the image servers. So you're gonna go to Sonet images.
If you list out the folders, we should see Revsolve on there.
Yep, yeah. So we need to go into it first to remove any subdirectories.
Uh yeah, CDCD go go into the folder.
All right. And there should be some subfolders here. So if you list them out, you should see. Yeah, all right. And all of those look to be empty.
So you can just remove them all. So if you do RMDIR.
You know you don't need to go into them and then just do a star, space star.
Where where that space?
Yeah, so that'll remove all of the subdirectories here.
Oh, I think you need to pseudo Sue's on it first. Yeah.
I I almost remembered it in time.
Yeah, so now if you do it, it should work. There you go. All right, so you have to do that first before you can delete the main folder. Like you can't have anything inside of a folder to before you delete it. So that's why you have to do this step. But yes, now if you go back up, now we can.
Remove der revsolve.
R under no go go go back up a level to the images directory.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   51:18
No, no web one web one server.

James Maki   51:29
And we need to remove the Revsol folder.
Yeah.
Uh, so now do RMDIR revsolve.
Uh, no, no, no, no. Revsolve, not star.
Yes, there you go.
OK, perfect. OK, so they have been removed off this server. And yes, now you want to do the exact same thing over on the RPA 01 server.
And then after that we'll we can remove them from web 01.
And then that should be all of them.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   53:48
James.
OK, WDI.

James Maki   53:53
Yeah.
Yeah, there you go.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   54:01
Now from web one.

James Maki   54:05
Uh, Yep.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   54:08
So do we need to do it in the same pattern like first RP O2, RP one and then web one?

James Maki   54:16
It doesn't really matter what order you go in.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   54:21
Hmm.
Yes.
Same Jin.

James Maki   54:50
Yes, it's all gonna be the same.
Yeah, there's there's gonna be a little bit more to delete on the FTP folder.
So like like cause like so images is gonna have subfolders right? So you need to remove those first.
If I if you do the the if you do the RM dir star now, the only thing it'll probably delete is the process folder.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   55:28
Okay, shall I do that?

James Maki   55:30
Yeah, I mean, you can.
So those other things are those dot FT PS. Those are files, not folders, so those aren't going to be included in that. The the RM only removes directories. That's specifically what's for is removing is removing folders.
RM is for removing files, so you can go ahead and you can you can do that RM star.
And that'll take out the dot FTP files.
Yep.
All right, so if you if you list out the contents now, the only thing left should be the images folder. And that's because it has. That's because it has things in it. There's still the the subfolders inside of images. Yeah, so let's go inside images.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   56:23
Right.
Yes.

James Maki   56:33
And see if you can remove.
Yeah, and try and remove those folders. So try try the RM dir star.
If I if they have any files in any of their subdirectories, then it won't let us. OK, all right, so it looks like it did all of them except for the Experian one. All right, so if you list out the contents, you should see that folder there.
All right, so let's go inside there.
And let's see what's inside list about.
OK, just a couple random files. OK, yeah, we can remove those. So just RM star.
Yeah, there you go. All right. And now we should be able to remove that Experian directory. So if you go back up a level, you should be able to remove it now.
Uh, you have to tell it my folder to delete.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   58:03
So we need to delete EXPR now, right?

James Maki   58:11
You do, but you can't do it from inside of it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   58:17
Um.

James Maki   58:18
So the the last time you tried to do it, you just put RM dir. You didn't put the star or EXPR like you you didn't tell it what to delete. That's why I said it's missing the operand.
Like you, you just put the command, but you didn't tell it what to do with it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   58:38
MDI it's it's bear, right?

James Maki   58:39
So there's so well, so so you're already in that folder now. So if if you look at the blue where you're at, you're in that folder, so you can't, you can't delete it from inside.
You have to go back up a level.
Now you can delete it.
There you go.
Alright, and now you can delete the images folder.
All right, so this is now empty. Now you can go back up a level and delete this one as well.
Yep.
There you go. All right, so they have been removed from all of the servers. So the only thing that you are not able to do right now is the the repo part, which isn't terribly important.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   59:41
I.

James Maki   59:43
I mean like really like we just want to remove it just to.
Kinda keep the repo as clean as possible, but it's actually it's not critical that that happens. So all right, so you're you're done with the rest of part. This company has been fully disabled.
So nothing else that you need to do on this one. So this one this was a this was a two company job. So this is Revsolve and USCB.
So over on the USCB side.
Yep, so this one is a sonnet hosted FTP one. If you look at the additional settings, they do not have the push pull command.
So we are hosting this one for this client, so I don't want to. I don't want to delete their folder just yet since we made a step three file for them and they're going to want that receipt that they worked in Sonnet.
But we can go ahead and disable them inside of Sonnet. So so you can go ahead and set the termination date and turn off the is active.
And that'll do all the sonnet portion for this.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:01:09
OK.

James Maki   1:01:10
And then I wanna wait until tomorrow to to do the FTP side of it, just to give him a chance to pick up that last file and.
Yeah, and just close out everything that they did inside of Sonnet.
So, so we're not going to do that portion for USCB today.
We can do that for tomorrow, but on the ticket we can say user access has been disabled.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:01:34
OK.

James Maki   1:01:43
Uh, for for.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:01:43
Reminder we should say, right?

James Maki   1:01:48
What's that?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:01:51
To Amanda, only Vishopse, right?

James Maki   1:01:54
Uh, yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:01:54
So she made interest in this one.

James Maki   1:01:57
Yes, yeah, I made a requested this one. Yeah, like any any deactivation request should come from, yeah, like someone.
Uh, someone with Impravana. Uh.
Amanda or I don't know. I don't know if anyone else is gonna be.
Making those requests but.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:02:21
we have deactivated reso.

James Maki   1:02:22
Revsolve and USCB inside Sonnet.
And then if you want to list out the other things that we've already done, you could say we've also removed revsolve from the servers.
We did that as well.
And that's really and that's good enough for right now and and if you want to keep this open until tomorrow and then we'll we'll complete the USCB side of it.
And then when that's done, then you can close out the ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:04
OK, so tomorrow morning we can just remove all the folders from the servers, right?

James Maki   1:03:11
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tomorrow we'll finish removing, yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:13
So afterwards, OK, so after that we can close this ticket.

James Maki   1:03:18
Yes.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:21
OK.
so let me put it on pending

James Maki   1:03:25
Uh, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, yeah, you can you can do pending.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:41
Action professionals.

James Maki   1:03:43
Yeah.
Uh, so yeah, so you're just gonna you're gonna follow all those same steps.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:52
Oh, yes, I will do that later on.

James Maki   1:03:55
Yeah, that's totally fine.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:03:58
Mm.
So Sadar was asking about 1 ticket.

James Maki   1:04:00
Yeah.
Yeah, let's look at that one. What was that? Yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:04:06
OK.

James Maki   1:04:10
Oh, did we get, did we get 2 tickets? Is that one from Andrea? Is that for the same thing?
The the.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:04:22
So are you looking into this?

James Maki   1:04:26
Well, I just see that Andrea also put in a ticket for Navy. She did. OK, so so this one and 869 are are the same ticket.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:04:40
In March.

James Maki   1:04:42
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and merge the 869. Merge that into the 868.
Yeah.
Yeah, and it's it's gonna give you a warning since.
Andrea Andrea's from Pravana and Whitney is from Navy. So that's what the warning, that's what this is saying. So just continue merge.
Yeah, commas private. Perfect. Yeah. Confirm. Cool.
All right.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:05:28
So what about this James? United auto credit? Did you know?

James Maki   1:05:33
So we got their disputes from today loaded, but they still have some from last week that are having trouble. So there's there's nine that that were missing SOR data and I set them back to new status to try and so we could reprocess the files.
And just like 2 Accord, there's still a few that are not getting loaded.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:05:59
I want to reply the responder.

James Maki   1:06:01
Yeah, that's a that's a really good question. All right. Yes, I do. I was trying to.
Take a closer look at those.
Um.
Alright, um.
What's the best way to do this?
United Auto.
Yeah.
Uh.
All right.
Uh, so I'm going to. I've moved their 612 files back again. Uh.
And I'm going to try.
And to.
All right, so I'm just manually loading to step 2 files again, the 612 ones for them.
And.
Just doing what I can to try and see if there's any.
Uh errors here.
All right, so.
OK, I guess ID.
I don't think that's one of the IDs that we're looking for here 07 to 07.
No, see that.
Right. And sorry, nothing in the.
All right. Yeah. So I'm really not sure 517.
I'm not sure why the data for these is refusing to load.
Uh, so if we go back over here.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:10:08
Thames I'm gonna look for true accord. It's also not clearing.

James Maki   1:10:11
I guess.
What's that?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:10:18
Oh, for through account.

James Maki   1:10:20
Yes, yeah, Truecore does seem to be having the same issue. Yeah, so I mean only we can only work on one at a time, so.
Let's see if we can get these guys fixed.
Alright, so.
11/30/1213 and 12:40.
12:40.
All right, so it should be on any of these step 2 files.
Alright, and there's the record.
So why is this not loading when it's right there?
OK.
Uh, let's focus on just these account numbers.
All right, So what I'm gonna do?
So and we need to make sure you guys are able to do this also.
Uh, do you guys have the Bash software installed?
That get get bash. I know we talked about it in the past.
Uh, but that's what I use to pull files down.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:12:23
In same days we have.

James Maki   1:12:24
Uh.
You do have it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:12:32
Yes.

James Maki   1:12:34
OK, great.
All right, so whenever you're gonna pull the file off of the FTP server, you have to run this command first, which creates this little config set up here. And so this is kind of like your SSH key basically.
That, uh, authenticates you to the server.
Uh, So what I'm gonna do?
Is.
Use this command.
And I'm going to get.
This file name.
And download it right here.
All right, so here is.
Don't worry about an update right now.
All right.
So there's one.
Bottom line #2.
That's three.
Alright, I wanna focus on just these account numbers.
So I'm trying to single them out and actually, how about we do this instead? Let's cut those and let's just move them all to the bottom.
Alright, only three more.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a new step two file with just these records so that I know these are the 9.
And there's nothing else in here.
And this way.
There we go. All right, take out these.
And I'll save this.
Uh, let me get a new name. Uh, just so it's separated and.
Uh, easier to track. I don't need to do that because I already have a batch right here.
And so now instead of that.
The.
I'm just going to do start dot CSV since that's the only one that's there. All right, so kind of reversing my command here. Now I'm going to upload the only CSV or all the CSV files I have here, which is only one. Upload that back to the FTP server into the United Auto.
Directory.
Which now we see.
All right, so now we can process this file.
With just these nine accounts and see what happens.
And it says it only found one.
I.
But.
I do not understand.
Why this data is not loading?
No.
All right. Is there something in here?
Oh.
ACDV not found with given statuses and conditions.
Now what are these two?
20 seconds.
All right, I don't understand what's happening.
I mean, it seemed.
I mean, I wanna say it's related to the band service.
But I could be wrong.
Uh, there's also a lot of duplicates on this account. That could be the reason it's having trouble. Like maybe it's trying.
Maybe for some reason it's trying to.
I mean it says ACDV not found with given statuses and conditions.
Alright, and what did it say?
I said the exact same thing with this.
So version two and you both had the same results.
It's finding this ID. What is this ID? Oh, what'd I just hit?
Participants. OK, I'm good.
What is this ID?
All right, looks like it's this this account number.
Alright, so on this one.
Is it?
It is. OK, all right, so this one, there's a duplicate account. Seems to be part of the problem here.
So trying to process this Step 2 file, it's not seeing the accounts that's in new status. It's only seeing the account that's in active status, so it keeps applying the information to this account.
And it's ignoring the other one.
Which is this one?
Where there's like no indication that it's been trying to process on the step two file, even though it's been trying to process the whole time.
All right. Is that control number? Is that specified?
Doesn't look like it, so it looks like they have the account numbers here at the end.
And maybe that's part of the problem.
Uh, I'm not sure.
All right.
To accord.
Hey, true accord at least. Hey, they're down to 0 waiting for data.
That's cool.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:25:54
Yes.

James Maki   1:25:55
Awesome. So on the True Accord ticket, you you can let them know that it they're all available. That one. That one looks. Yeah, you can close that one. Sweet. All right, well, at least that one's good to go. So it's just United Auto that's being a pain.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:26:01
Yeah.

James Maki   1:26:11
OK.
All right.
Uh.
On United Auto if you want to tell them.
All of today's disputes are available. There's nine accounts.
That are having trouble loading data.
And tell them that we're escalating those to our dev team for assistance.
Awesome.
And and I guess really, that's kind of all you can say.
Alright, I'm gonna stop sharing. Yeah, United Auto, that's at this point these these nine accounts, this is one or these are ones that I do wanna talk to Amanda about.
We have. I have just so many tickets now that I want to talk about on our Level 3 call tomorrow, assuming that we actually get to have it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:27:41
But she's not at all scheduling that call.

James Maki   1:27:47
I know.
Oh yeah, and uh and.
Does does she have another open ticket?
Yeah, tell her we will follow up on ticket.
What one is it?
Oh, alright, alright. It might already be solved. Um.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:28:35
Return this.

James Maki   1:28:37
I thought Manju had another ticket from her and I was gonna say we'll follow up on that ticket about the just piece of missing data, but.
Yeah, I'm not finding it now, so oh, here it is.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:28:53
James.

James Maki   1:28:54
OK, that's fine.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:28:56
for this one.
Oh, to deactivate the API clients. So do we need to do the same process that we did before?

James Maki   1:29:08
Yes, the the only difference is that you also need to remove them from the API O2 server.
But yeah, API 02, yeah.
There there is no 01, it's just the 02 server. But yeah, so that that's that's the only difference. So everything else is, everything else is the same. So just one more server to remove them from.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:29:30
Yes.
OK, so sudden.
Oregano. So I think they have.
Send the step to friend.

James Maki   1:29:55
OK, yes, so.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:29:55
OK, I will do that and now. So this one James. So I think we haven't done the client setup for API.
We done only for FTP clients.

James Maki   1:30:10
Uh, the instructions are in the.
Like it's it's it's the same instructions.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:30:19
OK, so till that server because I was not having the repose access, so I have done till that in the server what we need to do right?
So I have a little bit over there. So after that into Visual Studio I haven't done.

James Maki   1:30:30
Uh, yes.
Right. So if you want, we know we can do that tomorrow with with Manju back on the call. We can just have him. We can take him through that portion since he does have the repos.
So yeah, so if you wanna wait till till tomorrow to close the ticket for that, we'll.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:30:55
I think this one is not, uh, urgent, right?
Means we can make it tomorrow also.
'Cause she has asked this for June 4th exactly.

James Maki   1:31:08
Oh, wow. That's been sitting there for a while. Oh, OK, yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:31:12
I don't know. It came into my bucket on Friday only. So before that I don't know who sent me this assigned me this.

James Maki   1:31:23
OK. Yeah, I don't see, I don't see an initial response on there.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:31:29
Yeah.

James Maki   1:31:30
Yeah, I don't know.
Uh, OK.
Yeah, well, and so for implementation, like there's not really shouldn't be anything that you have to do for CQA setup other than whitelist the IP addresses.
So you can you can go ahead and send those in the in the Kato chat if you want.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:31:49
Mhm.

James Maki   1:31:56
And tell them that they need to be whitelisted for the CQA and prod API.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:32:05
But we haven't set up the client at right. We haven't implemented so.

James Maki   1:32:11
Sure, but you can, but they can do. They can go ahead and do the white listing though, because that's not really tied to anything else. So you can send that, so you can get that part done for them at least and then.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:32:24
So which of all these all these three and?

James Maki   1:32:24
Yeah, and and then that's one thing.
So so non prod is going to be the CQA one and and then prod is going to be prod. So they just need to whitelist that one IP address for CQA and then the other two for production.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:32:47
And the ghetto.

James Maki   1:32:50
Yeah, the Kato chat. Yeah, Kato whitelisting. That's it.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:32:59
So to whom I need to ask?

James Maki   1:33:02
Uh.
You don't need to direct it to anyone specific, just say can someone please whitelist the following?
And a non prod I would change change that to CQA.
Because non-prod is not specific enough.
Yeah, like where it where it says non prod, I would change that to CQA.
Yeah, yeah, there. Yep, I would do it just like that.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:33:44
I'm Lisa and for prod.

James Maki   1:33:49
Yeah, I mean that's that's fine. Yeah, like they they understand what broad is, so.
Yeah, so, yeah, yeah. So Cameron is is who normally does it, but I see he's added a couple more people to the group. So that's why I say you don't have to specify who I I haven't had any interaction with those other guys yet, but.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:34:02
OK.

James Maki   1:34:16
Yeah, whoever gets to it. So they should, they should let you know when that part's done. And then, yeah, and then we'll do.
All right, let's, let's check inside CQA real fast. Is there anything that we have to do there?
What was the company? What was that set up for? What was that?
That long name Santander.
OK.
Yeah.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:34:52
I don't know I can. The disputes has loaded in this also.

James Maki   1:34:59
Perfect. All right, you can let her know it's done.
All right.
All right. Is that a good stopping place for today?

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:36:00
Yes, James.
Thank you. Thanks for your time.

James Maki   1:36:08
Alright, no problem guys. Yep, I will talk to you tomorrow or I guess later on today for you. It's already you're ahead of me.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:36:15
Yes, it's already 3:00 AM.

James Maki   1:36:18
All right.
Yeah, Yep. All right. Well, I'll let you guys go get some sleep.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   1:36:25
OK. Thank you.
