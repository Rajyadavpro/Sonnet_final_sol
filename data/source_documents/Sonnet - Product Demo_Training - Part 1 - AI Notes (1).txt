Meeting notes:
Sonnet Dashboard Overview: Andrea provided an overview of the Sonnet dashboard, explaining its purpose and the data exchange process with clients. They highlighted the different tiles on the dashboard, such as the E Oscar response queue, disputes waiting for system of record data, and disputes received and completed today.
Dashboard Purpose: Andrea explained that the Sonnet dashboard provides at-a-glance information about disputes and behind-the-scenes processes involving data exchanges with clients. The dashboard is the landing page when users log into Sonnet.
Data Exchange Process: Andrea described the data exchange process, where Sonnet reaches out to E Oscar to download disputes and exchanges data with clients. Clients provide consumer and account information, which Sonnet displays side by side for users to work on disputes. Completed dispute information is sent back to both E Oscar and the client.
Dashboard Tiles: Andrea highlighted various tiles on the dashboard, including the E Oscar response queue (disputes waiting to be sent back to E Oscar), disputes waiting for system of record data (disputes downloaded from E Oscar but awaiting client data), disputes received today, disputes completed today, and disputes within 5 days of the due date.
Dispute Backlog: Andrea mentioned the dispute backlog graphic, which shows the total number of disputes in Sonnet, the number of days until disputes are due, and the queues where disputes are located (active queue, QA queue, work in progress queue).
Data Exchange Frequency: Khushboo inquired about the frequency of data updates from the system of records. Andrea explained that for most clients, the data exchange happens once per day, with some high-volume clients exchanging data a few times a day.
Frequency of Updates: Andrea explained that the data exchange with clients typically happens once per day because E Oscar pushes out new disputes at one time during the day. This frequency is sufficient for most clients as there are not many new disputes throughout the day.
High-Volume Clients: For very high-volume clients, data exchanges may occur a few times a day to handle the larger volume of disputes. This ensures timely updates and processing of disputes.
Periodic Data Pulls: Andrea mentioned that clients might want to pull data more frequently to get responses back after users have worked on disputes throughout the day. This allows clients to periodically update their records with completed dispute information.
Dashboard Customization: Khushboo asked if the dashboard is customizable by clients. Andrea confirmed that the dashboard is static and not customizable by clients.
Dashboard Interactivity: L Shashank asked if the dashboard tiles are interactive and if data can be exported to Excel for deeper analysis. Andrea explained that the dashboard is not interactive, but there is a reporting section that supports some of the information displayed on the dashboard.
Custom Reporting: L Shashank inquired about custom reports requested by clients. Andrea explained that custom reports are added to the reporting section, and if a report is applicable globally, it is added as a global report.
Dispute Queues Overview: Andrea provided an overview of the different dispute queues, including the active queue, work in progress queue, QA queue, completed today queue, and error queue. They explained the purpose and functionality of each queue.
Active Queue: Andrea explained that the active queue contains disputes for which data has been received from the client and are ready for users to work on. It also includes disputes at risk of expiring or those repeatedly presented to the client without data.
Work in Progress Queue: The work in progress queue is a global queue visible to all users. It allows users to save their progress on a dispute and return to it later. Disputes in this queue are associated with the user's name who moved them there.
QA Queue: The QA queue is a permissions-based queue typically accessed by supervisors. Users can send disputes to the QA queue for additional review, especially for complex disputes or when a new employee is being trained. The supervisor is responsible for completing and submitting the disputes from this queue.
Completed Today Queue: The completed today queue contains disputes that have been completed and submitted back to E Oscar on the same day. This queue helps track the daily progress of dispute resolutions.
Error Queue: The error queue contains disputes that were rejected by E Oscar due to errors. Users can correct the errors and resubmit the disputes. The error messages from E Oscar are specific, helping users identify and fix the issues quickly.
Work in Progress Queue: Khushboo asked if a dispute saved in the work in progress queue can be picked up by someone else. Andrea confirmed that it can be picked up by another user, and all changes made by different users are logged.
QA Queue: Andrea explained the QA queue, which is a permissions-based queue typically accessed by supervisors. Users can send disputes to the QA queue for additional review, especially for complex disputes or when a new employee is being trained.
Error Queue: Andrea described the error queue, which contains disputes that were rejected by E Oscar due to errors. Users can correct the errors and resubmit the disputes.
Error Identification: Andrea explained that the error queue contains disputes rejected by E Oscar due to errors. The error messages from E Oscar are specific, indicating the exact issue that needs to be corrected, such as an incorrect response code or a bad value in the payment history.
Error Correction: Users can open disputes from the error queue, correct the identified errors, and resubmit the disputes to E Oscar. This process ensures that disputes are accurately resolved and accepted by E Oscar.
Timing of Errors: Andrea mentioned that errors are communicated with E Oscar via an API, and responses are sent back throughout the day. Disputes can be returned in error status within approximately 5 minutes, allowing for quick correction and resubmission.
Monitoring Error Queue: All users have visibility of the error queue, and they typically monitor and correct errors throughout the day. This ensures that errors are addressed promptly and disputes are resolved efficiently.
Custom Work Queues: Andrea explained that clients can configure custom work queues based on certain fields. These queues are commonly used to separate disputes with higher complexity or specific types, such as fraud or bankruptcy-related disputes.
Dispute Assignment: L Shashank asked if custom work queues can be assigned to specific users. Andrea explained that custom work queues are visible to all users, and the management of queues is handled by clients through their policies and procedures.
Dispute Locking: Vinay asked about locking disputes when multiple people are assigned to the same queue. Andrea explained that disputes are locked when a user is actively working on them, and other users cannot access the locked dispute.
Dispute Unlocking: L Shashank asked about unlocking disputes if a user pauses work and does not return. Amanda explained that disputes are automatically unlocked after 15 minutes of inactivity, and users can send disputes to the work in progress queue with notes for others to see.
Dispute Details: Andrea provided an overview of the dispute details page, explaining the information displayed in the header, consumer information, account information, payment history profile, images, and notes. They also explained the response tabs for E Oscar and system of record.
Next Steps: Khushboo suggested scheduling additional sessions to cover the remaining topics. Andrea and Amanda agreed, and they planned to continue with AUDs and notifications in the next session.
Follow-up tasks:
Next Session Scheduling: Coordinate and set up the next training session for tomorrow at the same time. (Khushboo)
Future Session Planning: Schedule a 90-minute session for Friday or next week to continue the training. (Khushboo)
