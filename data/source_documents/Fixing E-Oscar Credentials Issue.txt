Fixing E-Oscar Password Issue
Overview
This article outlines the process and command usage for executing migration operations within the Sonnet Probe environment. These operations are typically performed using Node.js scripts to interact with the eoscar:api:migrate endpoint.
Environment Details
User: sonnet
Host: prdrpa02
Working Directory: /sonnet/scrape/sonnet-probe
Command History Analysis
The following commands were executed to perform migration tasks:
Command Breakdown
node app.js: Executes the Node.js application.
-o eoscar:api:migrate: Specifies the operation to be performed, targeting the eoscar API's migrate function.
-u: (Optional) Likely indicates an update or user-specific flag.
-c  : Specifies the configuration or command ID used during migration.
Observed Command IDs
26800
25000
17900
These IDs may correspond to specific migration batches, configurations, or operational parameters.
Best Practices
Always verify the command ID (-c) before execution to ensure it aligns with the intended migration scope.
Use history | grep migrate to audit previous migration commands for traceability.
Maintain logs in /sonnet/scrape/logs/YYYY/Mon/bonneville for post-operation review.
Troubleshooting Tips
If a migration fails, check the logs in the corresponding date directory.
Ensure that the Node.js environment is properly configured and dependencies are up to date.
Validate the API endpoint and parameters before execution.
Conclusion
Migration operations in the Sonnet Probe system are executed via structured Node.js commands. Proper usage and auditing of these commands ensure smooth and traceable data migration processes.
