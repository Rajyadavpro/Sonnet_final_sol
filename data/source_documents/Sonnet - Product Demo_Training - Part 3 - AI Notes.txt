Definition: Amanda explained that block notifications are alerts from the Bureau indicating that certain information has been blocked from a credit report due to identity theft or fraud. These notifications are crucial as they prevent the re-reporting of fraudulent information.
Importance: Amanda emphasized the importance of block notifications, stating that they are one of the most critical notifications from the Bureau. They require extra steps and careful handling to ensure that fraudulent information is not re-reported.
Handling: When dealing with block notifications, extra steps must be taken, especially when fraud or identity theft is involved. This includes thorough investigation and ensuring that the blocked information is not re-reported.
Difference Between Fraud Disputes and Block Notifications: Khushboo asked about the difference between fraud disputes and block notifications. Amanda clarified that fraud disputes involve specific dispute codes and may not always result in a block, whereas block notifications are direct actions taken by the Bureau to block information due to fraud.
Fraud Disputes: Amanda explained that fraud disputes involve specific dispute codes (e.g., 103 or 104) where the consumer claims fraud. These disputes require investigation and a response but may not always result in a block.
Block Notifications: Block notifications are direct actions taken by the Bureau to block information due to fraud. These notifications indicate that the Bureau has determined the information is fraudulent and has blocked it from being re-reported.
Correlation: Amanda clarified that while fraud disputes and block notifications are not directly correlated, a fraud dispute could result in a block notification if the Bureau determines the information is fraudulent.
Types of Block Notifications: Amanda described the two types of block notifications: block notification ID, which can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, and block trade line, which involves the entire trade line. She explained the data furnisher's obligation to review and accept these notifications.
Block Notification ID: Amanda explained that block notification ID can involve the entire consumer data set or just a piece of information, such as a social security number or address. The data furnisher must review and accept these notifications.
Block Trade Line: Block trade line notifications involve the entire trade line, meaning the entire account data set is blocked. These notifications require more investigation and careful handling by the data furnisher.

Block Rescission Request (BRR): Amanda detailed the process of a Block Rescission Request (BRR), which is used when a data furnisher believes a block notification is incorrect.

Example: Amanda provided an example of a consumer named Christy, who was making payments on her account. Despite this, her trade line was blocked. The data furnisher investigated and found no signs of identity theft, leading to a BRR to reinsert the trade line.
Investigation Steps: The investigation steps for a BRR include verifying the consumer's information, checking for signs of identity theft, reviewing the original contract, and ensuring all documentation is correct. If no fraud is found, a BRR is submitted to request reinsertion.
Supporting Documentation for Block Notifications: Sandeep asked if documentation is needed for block notifications. Amanda clarified that while documentation should be preserved internally, there is no way to transmit it back to the Bureau.
