Questionnaire on Topics Covered in the Meeting
1. What is the current architecture of the system?
2. What are the main components using Laravel or PHP as technology?
3. What are the Python services mentioned, and what are their purposes?
4. What is the role of Node.js in the system?
5. How is data encryption handled in the system?
6. What are the main databases used, and what are their purposes?
Sonnet DB – All Data
Log DB – Action Logs
7. What is the purpose of the log synchronization service?
UserAction is moved to the Log DB from Sonnet DB primarily due to the size which was causing Performance issue. In Sonnet DB 3 months of UserAction data is retained.
8. What are the environments used for development and testing?
Dev – Dev Testing
UAT – QA Testing
CQA – Customer UAT
Prod - Production
9. What is the process for handling batch clients and SFTP?

10. How are disputes images and receipts moved to the correct customer folder?
11. How are the demo disputes, with/without images and receipts generated in each environment?
Questionnaire on Topics Covered in the Meeting (WITH Answers)
1. What is the current architecture of the system?
The current architecture includes a web application (client-facing), Sonnet API, and Core system, all primarily built in Laravel (PHP 8.x). The architecture also includes various services like data files, encryption as a service, and tools for generating disputes and receipts. 2:56
2. What are the main components using Laravel or PHP as technology?
The main components include the web application, Sonnet API, Core system, data files, encryption as a service, and tools/scripts for generating disputes and receipts. 7:30
3. What are the Python services mentioned, and what are their purposes?
The Python services include Rules engine (currently in Python 2.7), AUD, and direct, which are being migrated to Python 3. The main purpose of Rules is to Recommend a response based on policies and procedures from the customer. 7:52
4. What is the role of Node.js in the system?
Node.js was the technology selected for creating Sonnet 4.0. In that plan we start building services like Sonnet Probe & Notary for managing receipts, OCR engine for text analytics, and various internal interfaces for system records (SOR). 9:46
5. How is data encryption handled in the system?
Data encryption is managed by the encryption as a service (SKMS Service), which encrypts and decrypts data acting as well as a key management system. This service is crucial for encrypting sensitive data like Social Security Numbers and Date of Birth. 5:49
6. What are the main databases used, and what are their purposes?
The main databases are Postgres for the main database stack, log database for logging, and a separate database for encryption as a service. Memcached and Redis are used for caching. 14:54
7. What is the purpose of the log synchronization service?
The log synchronization service moves logs from the main database to the log database, ensuring that logs are reflected after three minutes and deleting logs older than 3 months. 14:05
8. What are the environments used for development and testing?
The environments include local development, UAT (user acceptance testing), CQA (customer QA), and production. UAT is used for internal testing, while CQA is used for customer-facing testing. 1:07:21
9. What is the process for handling batch clients and SFTP?
Batch clients use SSH credentials to connect to the SFTP server, where datafiles manage the transfer of step 1, step 2 and step 3 files. The process also includes moving images and receipts to the correct locations. 28:10
10. How are disputes images and receipts moved to the correct customer folder?
The move images or name strategy service handles the movement and renaming of files based on customer settings. 6:15
11. How are the demo disputes, with/without images and receipts generated in each environment?
Disputes, images and receipts are generated using tools and scripts. DB Scripts are customized to generate specific disputes using customer's needs. 6:15
