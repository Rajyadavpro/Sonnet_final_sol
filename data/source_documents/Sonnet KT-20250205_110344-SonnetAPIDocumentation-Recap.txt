Key Topics:
Documentation Overview: Amanda provided an overview of the documentation in progress, focusing on the BRR data exchange and the different environments (production, development, CQA). 1:25
ACDV Process: Amanda explained the ACDV process, including the steps involved in handling disputes, the importance of the sonnet ID, and the possible actions clients might take based on their internal policies and procedures. 3:42
Debug Functionality: Amanda discussed the debug functionality, which helps in troubleshooting during the implementation process and can be used by clients to generate debug records for troubleshooting in production. 7:43
Step 2 Refresh: Amanda explained the Step 2 refresh function, which allows clients to keep their data updated by sending sonnet updated Step 2 information regularly. 8:33
Step 3 Process: Amanda described the Step 3 process, where users work on disputes in active status, complete them, and sonnet sends them back to E Oscar. The details of each dispute are then retrieved using the sonnet ID. 11:07
