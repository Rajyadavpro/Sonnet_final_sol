Checklist Configuration: Andrea explained that the investigation checklist can be configured on a per-client basis, allowing clients to determine which items to include based on their policies and procedures for thorough dispute investigations.
Checklist Usage: Clients can add items to the checklist that they want their users to complete during a dispute investigation. Users can check off items as they complete them, ensuring all necessary steps are followed.
Submission Independence: Andrea clarified that submitting a response is not contingent on completing the checklist items. The checklist serves as a double-check to ensure all required steps are followed.
Client Customization: Andrea mentioned that clients have access to configure the checklist themselves within the Sonnet UI, reducing the need for frequent requests to add or delete checklist points.

Client Workflow: Andrea noted that the presence of these flags in the Step 3 file can trigger specific processes on the client's side, although it does not automate any actions within their system of record.
Manual Notes: Andrea mentioned that clients can add notes and send disputes to the work-in-progress queue if they are waiting for additional information from the consumer, such as a copy of a bill.
Submission Options: Andrea outlined the different submission options available, including submitting a response, sending to QA, saving and exiting, and going to the next dispute.
Submit Response: Andrea explained that clicking 'submit response' sends the response back to E Oscar, marking the dispute as completed.
Send to QA: Andrea described that sending a dispute to QA requires adding a note explaining why it is being sent to QA, and then it moves to the QA queue.
Save and Exit: Andrea mentioned that saving and exiting sends the dispute to the work-in-progress queue, with an optional comment field for additional notes.
Next Dispute: Andrea noted that the 'go to next dispute' option, managed in user permissions, automatically takes the user to the next dispute in the active queue list upon submission.
Step 3 File Usage: Andrea and Khushboo discussed how clients use the Step 3 file to update their system of record based on changes made during dispute resolution.
Client Policies: Andrea explained that clients use the Step 3 file to update their system of record based on their company policies, ensuring that any changes made during dispute resolution are reflected in their records.

Dispute Completion: Andrea mentioned that at the very least, clients should note that the dispute was completed for the account, ensuring accurate record-keeping.
AUD Creation: Andrea demonstrated how to create an AUD from scratch or from an existing acdv, and how clients can use the API to automate AUD creation.
Create from Scratch: Andrea demonstrated that users can create an AUD from scratch by filling out a form and submitting it with the appropriate correction indicator.
Pre-fill Option: Andrea explained that if an account number has been seen in an acdv before, users have the option to pre-fill the AUD with the most recent response data to reduce manual entry.
Create from ACDV: Andrea showed that users can create an AUD directly from an acdv, which will then appear in the active AUD list for further modification and submission.
API Automation: Andrea mentioned that clients can use the API to automate AUD creation, allowing them to originate AUDs directly from their system and populate them in Sonnet.

Processing Reasons: Amanda mentioned that reasons for not processing an AUD could include internal policies, inability to locate the consumer, or mismatched account information.
Feedback Loop: Amanda emphasized the importance of the feedback loop provided by AUD notifications, which helps clients understand the status of their AUDs and take necessary actions.
DR Notifications: Amanda described DR notifications as updates from the bureaus about actions taken on reported trade lines, which may require clients to update their system of record.
Notification Types: Amanda explained that DR notifications include updates about actions taken on reported trade lines, such as changes made by the bureaus based on dispute responses.
Client Actions: Amanda mentioned that clients may need to update their system of record based on DR notifications to ensure accurate reporting and compliance with bureau updates.
Fraud Deletions: Amanda highlighted that DR notifications can include information about deletions due to fraud, which require clients to take specific actions to investigate and update their records accordingly.
