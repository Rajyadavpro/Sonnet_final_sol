                                     Large volume in step 3
Requested: we have a very large volume in step 3 appearing on the dashboard. If any of that volume contains block notifications would you please remove them so I know what our true number is
Steps:
Go to Pg admin and run the below query to check the block notifications and to remove the large fileso to Pg admin  —
      select * from facs_file_queue where company_id = 18400 and file_step = 3
**Here it will show the table with BL in dispute source.
 
delete from facs_file_queue where company_id = 18400 and file_step = 3 and dispute_source = 'BL'
** It will remove the BL in dispute source

Again run with select query to cross check whether BL has been removed or not:
select * from facs_file_queue where company_id = 18400 and file_step = 3
**If the dispute source is AU then it has been removed 


Close the task
