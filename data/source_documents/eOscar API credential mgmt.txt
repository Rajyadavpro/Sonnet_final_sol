48m 7s

Lidiexy Alonso   0:03
Yeah, day to you.
So during during that process of checking what is in the queue, you know you know what it is and everyone knows right now what is the responses and all that the numbers while piling up.

James Maki   0:06
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   0:18
So something is now good here.
Normally you will expect that in the morning around 8 probably will still, you know be a little bit of you know like.
A backlog, but after sometimes you start seeing oh.
Why this is going to not and sometimes just is because we stop.
The responses happened.
That's one case, but we didn't.
So we really want that.
If it was running and then I remember, oh, maybe because we did a restart of all the services, all the services in this weekend we did patching. OK, let me double check if they are running.
But yes, they were running.
Not a problem.
So all the responses were running as you can see.
I just run it again, but it was.
Everything was like that, like everything was running, the Chrome tab was, you know, like this. Like everything was OK and then what I did in the morning, I mentioned it to to James was let me stop one server, right.
And this is the server that I stopped response 01.
Let me show you real quick.
You see.
I stopped responses for this server.
And even the AUD submission right acdb submission and AUD submission, I stopped that.
And then I put this back.
It was like a couple of minutes ago.
Right. Couple of minutes ago I put it back.
So if I run it now, I don't need to run this one, but this is the command that we run.
We cannot target companies with submit. That's bummer.
We should, but he's not.
He's not built yet.
So what I was doing was this with both server stop, right?
Just running the command we I changed to Sona Yoskar connector.
So what I did was change to sonnet.
Yours got connected right.
And then start running this command.
No app dash.
O is the operation. When I was doing that.
Some customer pop up and I put it in the chat so it start popping.
Let me get here.
So start popping RECO.
It's still an issue.
Start popping abcu Atlanta postal and I saw this. This was.
The password and I changed it to this one.
How do I did it? You know how migrate that company specifically and I will show you it's right here.
Is this one I believe.
No, I don't know one of them.
So as you can see, this is RECO.
Greco again.
Maybe this one, I don't know.
Yeah, he's that one.
He's that one.
You see that this is Alana postal. All good.
So I run this and then seems like works OK let me see.
I start running this in order to get it, but I was enabled to get it.
How do I test that real quick?
If that is, if that is correct or not.
Because I'm curious about it.
Right. I want to know.
Honestly, I want to know if that password is correct.
So for RECO and the others, the others was easy because I just run this command ICTP submit and they pop up real quick.
But not for Atlanta, Atlanta.
So it's hard for me here in the they have some responses to get to do, but it's it's not getting there. Why maybe.
The automation maybe the wrong, but it was everything stopped.
So what?
I will do is just schedule a new download for Alana postal.
ABC.

James Maki   4:24
Yeah, so I'm confused 'cause. I'm not showing a login error on Atlanta postal.

Lidiexy Alonso   4:28
I did fix it.

James Maki   4:29
Oh, you did fix it, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   4:30
So in the responses we have issues.
Of course this is.
This is running for a long time. If I to go up I will not find it, but there I guess I have the error for some of them.
The error I'd send it to me, sunrise for example.
This is there that we are giving.
We are getting instead.
Imagine, instead surprise. It was apcl, right?
It was this same error.
You are not logging fail blah blah. Check your password.
OK, for for Ipco and startup typing.

James Maki   5:00
Mm H.

Lidiexy Alonso   5:03
So all of them here recovered the first one, APCO one, the second one, and then I say, OK, rec.
Apcu has only one company.
Why this is happening?
Oh, maybe because the migrate didn't work.
Let me run it again and then I run it again with this password in the database and this is the new password right now and it was success. All good. Awesome.
So is this right here you see?
That everything processed.
This is the password and no error.
All good.
So I I I thought, oh, everything is good.
But let's go to test if that is correct or not.
So I will do another line of postal no now.
I mean now, sorry. Now only a one time only. And I scheduled that. But before that, I need to prep myself to put Alana postal in a download mode so I can see here.
And not, you know, looking in the logs, it's something happens. So I will be ready in RPA.
No happy A/C to one, sorry.
RPA 02 is what I need.
The RPA O2.
So let me fix it up.
RPA 02 so I have API 02 to change passport here RPA O2 to execute downloads.
I will go to the Oscar connector, which is the one doing that, and then if I execute right now, there is nothing in the in the in the queue for them to download, right?

James Maki   6:56
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   6:57
So if I do.
This now we will have something in the queue and yes voila is connected. It is OK. It's downloading.
So the password is OK.
So now I can go here and I will say.
All git, so this is the new password.
Oh.
So I would forget about APC same as you see.
Avadime avai or whatever is this fix it?

James Maki   7:32
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   7:33
See these two were errors that now are.
Fix it.
We are still have issues with the RECO on consumer rights, OK.

James Maki   7:40
Alright, so so for Revco.
They do have multiple companies, right?

Lidiexy Alonso   7:45
Yep, right here.

James Maki   7:46
And so it looks like they. Yeah. And so it looks like they do have. It looks like they're all downloading separately so.
Like so? Like if? Yeah, exactly.
All right. Oh, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   7:58
Mm hmm.

James Maki   7:58
And you do have the password copied. OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:01
Yep. So what happened this morning when I saw the first one I saw was redpo.
What I did, and that's why is is the chat right.
The first one in the chat, so I saw this one.
Who? I saw this here.
And these three were that right.
That's exactly what I saw when I get in this morning to try and figure out what's what the heck is going on.

James Maki   8:22
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:24
So I saw that I said, whoa, that's the problem, right?
OK.
Let me change it back.
I change everything to this.
I just change everything to this and save right.

James Maki   8:38
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:38
But.
When I run it again, Redcoat came came in again.
Aw error again.
Oh, maybe the password was the other.
That's why I put those the two password here.
Oh, the password was not that. It probably this was. Was this one. OK, cool.

James Maki   8:49
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   8:54
Then I go back and update it again, back to whatever it was.
Let me refresh and that's it, change the database.
No, OK, I change it to this.
All of them the same.

James Maki   9:04
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   9:06
Run it again RECO again with error.
What I didn't know what to do right.
So both passwords that I have in my logic, they were wrong.

James Maki   9:18
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   9:18
OK, so I said OK.
Let me change the password.
We migrate, right?
That should be the case. Then I leave it this way and I I migrate REFCO 15600. When I did this error the password that you have is not the correct password so.
I was unable to change the password with these as the password as they correct old password.
Right. So maybe what's the other? And then put it back, so I put the other back this one.
Right and then right?
Save these and run it again.
Migrate that reco.
Error. What error? Everything was on error.
No matter what password I put, was returning on error. OK, I said. Well, OK, let me put every company of Repco here. Just go into organization 5600.
And then for every.
Single company sorry member credential ID in this case all of them.
This is the ID.
I went OK. OK.
You are.
You are the best, OK?
I will go back.
You know, haunting you right now.
So this one OK, when I go out, I put it here, then. Oh, enter then log in. Error safe.

James Maki   10:42
Yeah.
Alright.

Lidiexy Alonso   10:52
The next one log in error safe.
The next one loading error.
Safe, but this one, especially this one.
When I copy that one, it was down submitting.
It was submitting with this pass.

James Maki   11:08
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   11:08
Oh, what's going on here? We don't know.
I just remove this and put the lawyer on site. That's what I did.
James he was about to say something.

James Maki   11:19
Yeah, alright.
So just looking at their company settings like just looking at their schedules, so the only one that hasn't actually has the download scheduled is the main company and they do have subscriber code splitting turned on.
So I think everything should just be running through the main company from what it looks like.
So in addition to that, I also saw that you have four sets of credentials, but they only have three companies.
So it looks like.
So CRS is the one that is apparently duplicated for some reason, and I and I have no idea how that happened.

Lidiexy Alonso   11:54
Mm hmm.
Yeah, maybe. When when we do something like this, let me show you real quick. When we do something like this, James sometimes.
When we do update, sometimes when you are doing migrate, sometimes we create new. I need to check why but sometimes we are creating a new credential which is not OK.

James Maki   12:08
Mm hmm.
OK.
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's gonna be a problem.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:21
Mm hmm.

James Maki   12:22
All right, so it looks like in this case it looks like ID 5783 that second one.
Yeah, it looks like that's that's the duplicate for for CRS.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:29
A duplication.
A duplication.

James Maki   12:31
Yeah. So I don't know if we just wanna go ahead and delete that.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:35
I will.
I'm doing it now.

James Maki   12:37
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:38
Oh, don't.
What's going on here?

James Maki   12:39
But then it looks like.
Yeah, I mean, it looks like we don't need those credentials.
On CRS and and the pit P ITT.
Like if they don't have it, if they, if they don't download scheduled and they are also not.

Lidiexy Alonso   12:58
Oh.

James Maki   13:05
Like the responses should all be running through the main company, right?
Or at least as far as like.
Like as far as like the Oscar's concerned.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:13
I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure about that, but responses can have multiple if it's the same is the same.
So you can have 3-4 whatever credentials with the same 4 responses doesn't matter.

James Maki   13:26
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:26
Download is is the is the main issue and the download we are using this one normally.
So what's happening now?

James Maki   13:32
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   13:34
Yep.
What happening now is these credential has.
Responses attached.
Let's do it.
So let's go to responses team response queue.
Member credential ID is equal to.
Please client.
And well, I don't know if we completed or not.
So probably we have completed also.
So what do we do?
Then company we have company here that company but we don't organization right.
Yeah, we don't have organization, OK.
Let's do.
And company ID.
In then that will be 1660.
Let me start with the one because that's the one that we need right now.
Yep, and all of them are complete.
So we complete some disputes.
With that credential, by the way.

James Maki   14:48
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   14:49
And they were complete.
Today, no.
Two days ago.

James Maki   14:56
Yeah. Friday 27th. Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   14:58
Yeah, yeah. Friday.
So we can do something right because we want.
Let's check if we have work for that for this one for the 80.
A bunch more, right? So OK.

James Maki   15:11
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:14
Let's let's do this.
Azulis. OK, let's save here.
And then let's go on delete this one.
So we have less headaches.

James Maki   15:29
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:31
There you go. OK, less headaches right now.

James Maki   15:31
Yeah. All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:35
But in 27.
This password was working.
Oh, that's a good that's a good point. So Friday.
These password was the one assigned to this company.
And it was working.

James Maki   15:54
Mm H.

Lidiexy Alonso   15:55
So today these new password probably when you run the command James this new password was here.

James Maki   16:06
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:07
So when we do that, we need to go with those and change all the password to do the same.
So this is the the process. Normally when you go you need to go with those that you know that has multiple companies with the same password and you need to update just in case update all those just to have to avoid issues.

James Maki   16:25
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:26
But the the problem now is that seems like we lock.
The accounts.
It's my. It's my humble opinion.
I don't know what's going on, but.
Nor this one or the other.

James Maki   16:40
Yeah, I mean, I mean like if if, like responses like we're trying to submit like on one of the other companies that didn't.
Like that.
Didn't update or something like that.
Like maybe that's what's causing it.
Umm.

Lidiexy Alonso   16:52
So at this point I will say customer I will, I will talk with the customer.
Hey guys. We need you to reset the password and then we will just reset it again and make sure that we do it.
You know, we do it properly and change all the password because if something is running like responses and it's taking these and erroring out is using the same RECO right? And if?
Multiple times.
And this is different then you know that will make a mess.
And that's exactly why it was the stock, the responsible stock.
This is one of the cases. So right now all of dynamic vlogging error.

James Maki   17:26
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:29
So we need to talk with the customer in order to reset this.
That's one thing.

James Maki   17:32
Right.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:34
But this is getting more interesting.
This makes sense.
All good that happens.
I will go to the most interesting case, sunrise.
Sunrise this morning has an error. When I was trying to submit right, I was submitting from Reiser. Boom. Say OK.

James Maki   17:50
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   17:53
Oh, look at this.
This one also has error.
That's a good point.
Look at this.
Our RSA MD OK.
Let's look for that.
That's what I did.
Perfect, perfect timing.
So say blah blah blah.
So who is this?
RSI Enterprise Thirty 3800. So oh, we have subcompanies.
Oh, this is probably getting to the same case of the other. Let's let's go to the database.
Organization. 3838 hundred. Yeah. Yeah, we have these.
Then I will do what I did this morning.
RSA.
Password one current.
Please.
And then give an error right?
That's giving some errors, so we double check that company 123 all good.
So there is the same thing is exact same case as what is the other sunrise.
No sunrise, no. James. I'm here.

James Maki   19:06
Revco revco.

Lidiexy Alonso   19:07
Yeah, it's the same case as Reko.
So cool.
We have this a problem. We have a problem here, but all the passwords are the same.
Hmm, let me.
Go to the responses and this will be company ID 3800.
Then all good.
So we respond last time.
Order by.
This Friday.
We respond on Friday.
OK, makes sense.
Maybe we have the issue right in Friday.
Expire blah blah blah. OK, let me look for one.
Nothing for one.
Of course, because they are different member credentials.
Lady, come on yourself.
This is all one.
Are you sure that 01? There's nothing here.
I get to get this next one.
Is it 402?
Nothing. Get the third one.
This is for outside.
There you go. We have something.
Maybe these two companies or one or two, maybe they're deactivated or something.
I don't want to go details on that, but there is no responses for these two.
But there is for this awesome.
Response queue. What was the last time?
18.
So a couple more days ago.
Cool. We have Friday anything makes sense.
James.

James Maki   20:50
Not just 18 tests. Well, 12 days ago.

Lidiexy Alonso   20:53
Yep, so there is no nothing else for 2:30 AO 203 in this case.

James Maki   20:58
OK, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:00
I don't know.
Maybe. Maybe we have some our RSASASE.

James Maki   21:01
All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:05
So maybe we have some and they're active company seems like it, but we have.
We have nothing for this one, nothing for this one.
OK.
Let's move on.

James Maki   21:16
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   21:16
When I saw these, I said OK.
This is the case of Reco, right, OK, OK.
Let me try to update that company.
Let me migrate that company.
At least try to do it 3800.
So the re company ID, yes.
Then monitoring this Member credentials and this is the password.
Good. I already put put this here now.
I didn't send it.
Let me send it.
Then we migrate.
He said that we will try to change the password.
The password has been changed. All good.
Voila, almost finish. So let me check now the database.
Refresh and voila, it changed only for one company. I need to put it everywhere.
That's what I do.
Or what?
That's what we do.
Who today we were update all the companies blah blah with the same password. Awesome.
The problem now is how to test.
So how to get it there?
It's difficult, right?
That's the problem.
We don't know if that password will be correct or not.
Now it's karmar, but so we would never get into that one.
Let's do a download for them to test it.
So let's go to schedule download.
3800.
Download 10.
Right now.
This ready for?
3800.
Add schedule pranet.
Mm hmm, trying trying trying.
It's downloading, so the password is correct.
Everything is correct the the.
The responses should be correct.
That's what I was expecting for RECO, but it didn't happen.
OK.
So all good.
All good, right?
I know we we cleared this one.
And then I would communicate with you.
So new pass.
Blah fix it.
Or all good. Whatever, right?

James Maki   23:51
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   23:52
OK.
All good.
So we still have more, but this is the interesting part.
We never get into this one sunrise. When I went to Run's Rice, it's only one company.
Sunrise. So is this company so 12700?

James Maki   24:05
Here it is. Yes. Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   24:10
He's only one company that you have only one US credential and all that. This is easy peasy. Super easy.
You will see when here, right?
I went all the step that I mentioned already, right when here you can see here.
Oh, new password. All good password succeed. All good.
Yeah, I'm done with that.
Even if you see.
In my chat that was so easy that I didn't put the password one.
I didn't put what was the current password.
I didn't went here to check for that company.
I was so confident that I didn't copy the old password.
And I put only the new one and put new password and everything.
Let me tell you, after that it didn't work.
So, lady, what the heck? I don't know. This is.
This is one of the mysteries.
So if I change the password and of course of course I test a download for them and as you can see, it's right here still right here an easy error.
So we changed the password.
As somehow.
We block it or do something, but it's not working.
So what else we need to do?
Nothing, because I tested several times later to try to reset the password again and it's impossible.
I I also did it here, you know, with, with, with this request and doing it manually, just calling the database I call in the the Oscar directly and nothing works so.
I think this is another case where we need to talk with the customer and say hey guys.
Somehow the password has to be reset.
Please reset it and send it to us and then we need to do the process that we know with the customer.
But it is super interesting that we get a password to see it with some with this, not this one.
But you know what I mean.
This one right here.
So we get a password to see and after that password succeed and everything should be OK.
It was still an error.
So we need to investigate why.
Later so I think. But I will say that maybe because this is what running.
I was running that at the same time multiple times.
I get it.
And it was an error still cache.
You can scream any other type of reasons, but it could be anything mystery this, this one or another error, right?
This is a new error right now so.
You see, this is interesting.
We need to call to the customer and.
And and reset this and so and so forth.
But this was the most interesting case because it was OK, only one company.
I don't need to go to the database and nothing like that.
But I will go now, right?
And we have only one thing, so nothing.
This is good, but it's not working.
OK.
This is the interest of case.
We have another case right now, just we figure out.
Let's go do the same process.
Company.
This is only one company.
Should be easy, right?
But I will not trust me anymore anymore.
3400.
OK.
This is the password.
Current password.
Neil.
Then I will go here and try.
To 35, right?
Don't remember now 34.
31.
Let's see.
Finger Cross seems to be OK.
Seems to be OK.
This is running the responses, so if we get it here and we have an error at the same time I don't know.
We got very blocked. Whatever. So let me double check that in the database we have the new password.
We're all good.
Let me put it here.
Now we need to test now.
So how do we test?
We schedule a new download for national recovery.
This one.
10 disputes one time, but I need to prep in my.
Download.
3400.
Add to schedule go back front and run.
There you go.
Log in to sis. So Susie.
Sorry all good.
So we fixed that one too.
But you saw it's easy when it's only one company, but that's on rice just didn't work the way we want it.
And that's what I've been doing for this morning pretty much.
Just running, checking, fixing the errors, fixing companies just to clear out this volume here to dashboard acdvs this volume here it was 11 or 12,000 at some point. Right now it's just three, whatever, but 1000 only is for sunrise.
We need to fix this pretty quick.
So that's the thing. I so any questions?

James Maki   30:15
All right, so ref ref, ref. Co and sunrise, those are the two we need to reach out to, right. All right.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:19
Yep.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:22
What about self?

James Maki   30:28
What about self?

Lidiexy Alonso   30:29
Self Lib Bank what's happening with self?

James Maki   30:33
Some of the control number errors.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:34
OK.
This is so yeah.
Sorry, sorry it's not related.
Yeah, the control number is they are like continuously opening those tickets.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:44
What but, but with fixed ad the 700 the other day.

James Maki   30:51
They have 800 and they have 870 in their area right now.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:51
We have more.

James Maki   30:56
So those are all.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   30:56
And.

Lidiexy Alonso   30:56
But.

James Maki   30:57
Those are not all control number errors, but there is a lot of them.

Lidiexy Alonso   31:02
Hold on. Hold on.
So you're telling me that?
Of course we did.
We did not deploy the fix for the duplication of the rule sending, so you're telling me that we have again no touch that are duplicating the rules engine.
In the the in the response que.
Is what you're saying.

James Maki   31:23
Let me double check.
Not not sure if there are no touch or not.
Alright, that one is.
So there's a mix.
Some of them are in attention, some of them are not.

Lidiexy Alonso   31:38
OK.
So let me count all the 2521400 right?

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   31:45
Yeah, company ID.
Supriya Manju keep an eye on self ticket and just drop a message to them as soon as we are, you know.
Resolving it.
Getting uneasy every passing hour.

Supriya Siddappa Kulageri   32:11
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:12
OK. Do you think that I can, I can just wait for you to reach RECO and Sunrise.

Manjunath S   32:14
OK, Sagar.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:20
And do you want me to move?
To keep running the you know, just let the let the servers run the responses and do.
Do not do this process anymore.
Manual process anymore to identify more.
Or or and then to jump into that issue with with their duplicates so.
So why?
Because you know, if this is priority.

James Maki   32:43
Yeah, I think that's.
I think that's fine.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:46
OK.

James Maki   32:48
Yeah. All right.
So so when we get those new passwords. So for us, do you wanna do you want to just send them to you or do you want us to try and fix these?
So we so we can.

Lidiexy Alonso   32:56
So I need the password, the reset password right for each of them.

James Maki   32:59
OK.
OK.
All right, so support guys.
So what we need to do?
Is we need to make tickets for those two companies for Revco and Sunrise credit.
So if you go over to their company and look at their list of users.
Find whoever their admin is.
And you're going to generate and you're going to make a new ticket in their name.
And you're gonna ask them?
To please reset the password.
For our E Oscar API login.
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:41
OK.

James Maki   33:43
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:44
James, please look my screen.
Everyone please.

Sagar Gurudatta Pai   33:48
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:48
You see that is there is not duplication right now.

James Maki   33:54
Look in E Oscar response table.

Lidiexy Alonso   33:59
You ask a response table.

James Maki   34:00
Yeah, change it from response queue.
Change it to E Oscar response.
We have to do a little bit different because actually I don't, I don't think company ID exists on that.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:13
Yeah.

James Maki   34:13
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:15
No, no, no, he's not.

James Maki   34:15
I can't remember now. Yeah, yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:16
He's not, he's just expired.
He's the prid.
But in the, at least in the response queue, we have 00 duplicates.

James Maki   34:26
Right.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:27
So should not be.
The responsive might be.
The user corresponds, as you say.

James Maki   34:31
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   34:34
So in order to do that, we will do something similar to.
These.
That being a little bit more complicated.
No.
Uh.
OK.
Where?
Are.
Hmm.
OK.
So what dispute ID?
Is Anthony bla correspo response?
I guess we need to do multiple joins here.

James Maki   36:07
Yeah. Problem.

Lidiexy Alonso   36:10
Yeah.
You are.
So.
Yeah, we'll be.
OK.
Is purely.
OK.
So in a joint blah blah company is equal to blah.
And.
And.
Sona, status please.
You want to complete.
No, I cannot do that.
Because they they are some, some of them are.
What else?
Oh, I don't need these.
I need these here.
OK, now make sense.
Maybe this will give me what I need.
Sure.
Ah.
And this might be related with the same idea of resenting, you know.
Running twice for those companies for those disputes.
I mean two entities.

James Maki   38:40
Yeah, that might be on some of them.
Yeah, might be on some of them.
Like the no touch ones, you mean?
Oh really?

Lidiexy Alonso   38:51
Running if you are running.
Two, the rules engine is running with two instances for the same dispute. If we don't have any like a select before insert into the response, the Oscar response will be duplicated right with the same data by the way.

James Maki   39:14
Oh, OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:15
But but only the note Tosh will have a duplicated entry in the response queue.
So so you got it right.

James Maki   39:25
I got got you.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:26
You got it.

James Maki   39:27
Yep.

Lidiexy Alonso   39:29
So that that might happen.
Yep, I know there is a lot of them.
So let me.
Group by blah.
OK, we might do something like.
So we might download these accounts.
How many we have?
That is not so many.
Not so many.
So let's go.
Not so many.
Let's go on.
There you go. So we have.
457 duplicates and I can copy this.
Send it to you.

James Maki   40:26
Just send me the query because yeah, because yeah, because.
Yeah, because that's exactly what I was gonna do. Is, I was gonna take those IDs from there and then just do like another select statement to get the IDs from the E Oscar Response Table.

Lidiexy Alonso   40:30
OK.
OK.
Yes, exactly.

James Maki   40:39
And then, yeah, and then go. Yeah. So then group those together and then. Yeah. And then I can. And then and then I can dedupe. Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   40:43
Let me order by.
Let me do the order by.
Yep, order.
By.
And they put here.
As a Kent or the Bicent?
My thing is descendant.
I think is that if not, just delete the other by and then do it the way you you want.

James Maki   41:11
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   41:15
There you go.

James Maki   41:17
Cool.

Lidiexy Alonso   41:18
So this is to find.
That duplicates.
Being eoscar response.
10.
There you go.
Yeah. Do you think?
Clean up.
Clean that up.
So Yep.
What else?
I think that's the issue.
So we need to.
We need to include on that logic in the. This is, yeah, there you go.
So this is we need to include into the logic.
Not only the the submit this submit response, so not only here in the response queue where is the change they made.
Response.
Queue now.
This one you see that I have a select first and then insert.
In the one that we have.
Insert probably this one as well.
Look for the fire response.
So we are probably doing this as well, so we need to do the same in five response in aniosco response.
You see that is just a straight to insert.
If it run it multiple times, that's the issue. So we will insert here and for sure we will insert here as well.

James Maki   42:40
Mm hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   42:45
So that's another issue that we will have and I will just, you know change.
The fax response and everything will be OK.
Oh, order by.
Probably order is a problem.
OK.
OK, I will now use the order by.
So you need to remove the other by names.
It's not, it's not correct.

James Maki   43:24
OK.

Lidiexy Alonso   43:26
Then.
I will respect the same 457 entries.
Look at this, none of them.
Zero man.
Put ascend then.
0 nothing.

James Maki   43:47
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   43:49
So that is weird.
There the logic in the rules engine.
Will insert the facts sub fact response pretty much after or before the Oscar response is inserted. If we go here.
You will see that the.
It is updated fax data.
Instead it was corresponds.
Insert the fax response and this is where. After that just delete from the response queue for the dispute queue. So those.
Two, if this is duplicate, this should be duplicate.
Should be.
It's not, but it should be.

James Maki   44:30
Yes.

Lidiexy Alonso   44:32
OK.
I don't know what else I need to check where where other place we have these.
And as you can see, it's only there.
So here is the only call.
So how in the world we have your corresponds duplicated?
If five points is not duplicated, let me check. Let me check for five response. Right now only one place.
So something fishy is going on here.
Anyway, I will update the Yosko response plus the fax response just in case to select first.
And then.
And then, oh, we have a delete from yourscre.
This is interesting.

James Maki   45:21
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   45:21
OK.
May I will work with that because we have a delete here for because if you pass something here, you pass the pure ID probably or something like that. You are able to blah delete.
Same. Oh, this is the thing.
That's why we don't have a duplicate.
Because five response delete before inserting every single time.

James Maki   45:48
Hmm.

Lidiexy Alonso   45:49
While.
He also responds.
Only delete if we pass a parameter.
On the bottom side, I gave you that later.
What will be the bottom?
Is here the Oscars point is 0.
I don't know.
What is that in zero?
But I I will be pretty fine.
And that's exactly why. So we only delete.
If the bottom is something.
That's the trick.
And we did this eight years ago, man.
So. So yeah, let me fix this somehow.

James Maki   46:26
Across.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:32
That will fix the response as well.

James Maki   46:37
No. OK, cool.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:38
What else?

James Maki   46:41
I think that's all I got for right now.

Lidiexy Alonso   46:43
As soon as you you delete those entries in the record. Once we're not have an issue.
If we run it again manually or whatever, we will probably have it so as soon as we deploy this logic that I'm creating right now, we will limit not not delete completely but limit the the issue.
And we will have one case whatever, but we should not have it.
Cool. Thank you. Ice being a pleasure.

James Maki   47:14
Right.
Yep. Thank you, Dave.

Lidiexy Alonso   47:18
Yep, you have a good day. Bye.

James Maki   47:21
Yeah.

Lidiexy Alonso   47:22
