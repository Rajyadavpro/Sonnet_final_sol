Key Topics:
DevOps Pipelines Overview: Chip provided an overview of the DevOps pipelines, explaining that every repository has a straightforward pipeline connected to the SonarCloud environment for static code analysis, which is required for security audits. 0:13
Pipeline Configuration and Issues: Chip discussed the configuration of pipelines, including the use of variable groups for authentication and the need to replace deprecated SonarCloud tasks due to node version issues. 2:41
Manual Production Deployments: Chip explained that due to the fast pace of hotfixes and customer requests, production deployments are handled manually, although they could be automated by uncommenting the relevant pipeline stages. 4:45
Deployment Script Details: Chip detailed the deployment script used for the Sonnet web app, which includes error handling, conditionals, and running various commands to ensure proper deployment. 8:09
Agent Pools and Environments: Chip described the use of agent pools for different environments (UAT, prod, dev) and mentioned that the dev environment has light use due to the presence of other environments. 5:45
Self-Hosted Pipeline Agents: Chip explained the use of self-hosted pipeline agents in Azure instead of Microsoft-provided agents due to internal VNet structure, and showed the service connections to the servers. 11:54
Azure Configurator Repository: Chip introduced the Azure Configurator repository, which contains scripts for configuring servers, including Apache, PHP, and other required packages. 14:23
Manual Triggering of Scripts: Chip explained that the scripts in the Azure Configurator repository are manually triggered, allowing for the selection of packages and configurations needed for each server. 20:39
Code Merging and Deployment Process: Vandana and Chip discussed the code merging process, which involves branching from main, merging back in after approvals, and triggering the pipeline for deployment to UAT. 23:43
Access Requests: Vandana requested access to Azure DevOps and SonarCloud to check a few things from their end, and Chip agreed to provide the necessary access. 29:06
Dev Environment Setup: Lidiexy suggested creating a dev environment for the Indian development team to start testing the web app, and Chip discussed the possibility of building a dev server in their environment. 30:11
