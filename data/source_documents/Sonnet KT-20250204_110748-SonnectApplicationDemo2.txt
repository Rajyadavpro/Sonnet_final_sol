Questionnaire on Topics Covered in the Meeting:
1. What are AUD notifications and what information do they contain?

2. What are block notifications and what actions should data furnishers take upon receiving them?
Answer: Block notifications inform data furnishers that certain consumer information or trade lines have been blocked due to identity theft.

3. What is the difference between a block tradeline and a block ID notification?

4. What is a BRR and what information must be included when creating one?
