CASE: Disputes came back with the same error..

Issue-->
I JUST processed to disputes and they came back with the same error (ACDV CONTROL NUMBER ERROR) Why is that? we don&#039;t touch those numbers. Due the time sensitive nature of these dispute can you please assist as quickly as possible? 

*****To resolve I ran this query to find the ids from the eoscar_response table:
select * from eoscar_response where dispute_id in (62373950,62373966)
 
there were 2 entries for each dispute so one had to be removed from each and then resubmit the response.
example: delete from eoscar_response where id = 159007747 (this is the id from eoscar_response and not the dispute_id so be careful when running this type of query)
 
this is one of the rare times we delete from eoscar_response table.
